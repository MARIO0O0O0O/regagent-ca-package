## TIMEKEEPING STANDARDS

**Required:** Employer must maintain accurate records of time worked.

**Best practices:**
- Use a timekeeping system that records actual clock-in and clock-out times (not just scheduled times)
- Never round time in a way that consistently favors the employer — rounding must be neutral or favor the employee
- Supervisors must not adjust employee time records without the employee's knowledge and agreement
- Preserve original time records; maintain audit trail of any corrections

**Employer burden of proof:** If time records are incomplete or missing, courts may draw inferences in the employee's favor based on their recollection. Keeping accurate records is the employer's legal obligation and litigation defense.

**[ ] Net wages** — accurate?  
**[ ] Pay period dates** — inclusive start and end date present?  
**[ ] Employee name and ID** — correct?  
**[ ] Employer name and address** — complete?  
**[ ] Hourly rate(s) and corresponding hours** — present for non-exempt?  
**[ ] Paid sick leave balance** — shown on stub or separate document?

## PAGA NOTICE PROTOCOL

If a PAGA notice is received from an employee or their attorney:

1. **Do not ignore it.** The notice triggers a 65-day window.
2. **Notify legal counsel immediately.**
3. **Preserve all relevant records** — document hold on any records related to the claimed violations.
4. **Assess the violation** — are the alleged violations accurate? What is the scope?
5. **Evaluate cure** — PAGA SB 92 (2024) allows an opportunity to cure certain violations within 33 days of LWDA notification. Curing eliminates or reduces exposure.
6. **Do not retaliate** against the employee who filed the notice.
