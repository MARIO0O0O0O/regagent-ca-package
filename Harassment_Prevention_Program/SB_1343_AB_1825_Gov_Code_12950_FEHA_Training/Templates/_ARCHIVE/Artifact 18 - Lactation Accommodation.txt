1. Facility Requirements (The "Clean Room" Rule)
You cannot tell an employee to use a toilet stall. The space must be:
* [ ] Private: Shielded from view and free from intrusion.
* [ ] Functional:
   * [ ] Surface to place a breast pump and personal items.
   * [ ] Place to sit (chair).
   * [ ] Access to electricity (or extension cords).
* [ ] Proximity: In close proximity to the employee's work area.
* [ ] Water Source: Access to a sink with running water (clean/safe).
* [ ] Storage: Access to a refrigerator (or cooler provided by employer) suitable for storing milk.
* [ ] Availability: Can be a temporary space (e.g., conference room), but only if it is available when needed and meets all criteria above.
2. Policy & Break Time
* [ ] Break Time:
   * [ ] Must provide "reasonable break time" each time the employee needs to express milk.
   * [ ] If possible, break time should run concurrently with mandatory Rest Breaks (Paid).
   * [ ] Additional time needed beyond standard breaks may be unpaid, but cannot be denied.
* [ ] Written Policy:
   * [ ] Must include the right to request lactation accommodation.
   * [ ] Process for requesting usage of the room.
   * [ ] Employer's obligation to respond (within 5 business days).
   * [ ] Right to file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner for non-compliance.
* [ ] Distribution: Must be in the Employee Handbook and given to any employee inquiring about parental leave.
3. CROSS-REFERENCE: HOW OTHER LAWS IMPACT LACTATION
3.1 HARASSMENT PREVENTION → LACTATION
Legal Principle: Discrimination based on "medical conditions related to pregnancy" is harassment. Compliance Impact:
* [ ] Jokes: Comments about breast pumping, milk storage, or time taken are actionable harassment.
* [ ] Privacy: Breaching the privacy of the lactation room is a violation. Cross-Reference: → [Harassment Prevention Checklist]
3.2 WAGE & HOUR → LACTATION
Legal Principle: "Hours Worked" vs. Breaks. Compliance Impact:
* [ ] Paid vs. Unpaid:
   * [ ] 10-minute rest break used for pumping = PAID.
   * [ ] Extra 15 minutes needed = UNPAID (Clock out).
* [ ] No Penalty: You cannot discipline an employee for "productivity loss" due to lactation breaks. Cross-Reference: → [Wage & Hour Checklist]
3.3 LEAVE LAWS → LACTATION
Legal Principle: Transition back to work. Compliance Impact:
* [ ] Integration: The Lactation Policy should be provided immediately upon return from PDL/CFRA leave. Cross-Reference: → [Leave Checklist 1-49]
4. Penalties
* $100 per day: Civil penalty for each day an employee is denied reasonable break time or adequate space.
* Retaliation: Damages for discharging/discriminating against an employee for exercising these rights.
