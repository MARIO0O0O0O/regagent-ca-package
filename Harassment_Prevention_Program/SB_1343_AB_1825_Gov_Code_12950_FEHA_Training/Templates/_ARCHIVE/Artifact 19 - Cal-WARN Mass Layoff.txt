California Mass Layoff (Cal-WARN) Compliance Checklist (2026)
Version: 1.0 Effective Date: January 1, 2026 Primary Mandate: Cal. Lab. Code § 1400-1408 Applicability: "Covered Establishments" (Generally 75+ employees, but triggers at 50 layoffs).
1. Trigger Events (When Notice is Required)
If any of these occur, you must give 60 days' notice.
* [ ] Mass Layoff: A layoff of 50 or more employees during any 30-day period.
* [ ] Relocation: Moving substantial operations to a new location 100+ miles away.
* [ ] Termination: The closing of an industrial or commercial facility (even if fewer than 50 employees, if it's the whole facility).
* [ ] Difference from Federal: Federal WARN requires 100+ employees and 33% of workforce. California requires only 50 employees laid off, regardless of percentage.
2. Notification Requirements (The "60-Day Rule")
Notice must be given at least 60 days before the separation.
Who Must Be Notified?
1. [ ] The Employees: Affected employees (or their union rep).
2. [ ] EDD: The Employment Development Department (State).
3. [ ] Local Workforce Development Board: The specific board for your county (e.g., LA County WDACS).
4. [ ] Chief Elected Official: The Mayor (if in city) or Chair of Board of Supervisors (if in unincorporated county).
Content of Notice
* [ ] Name and address of employment site.
* [ ] Name/Phone of company official to contact.
* [ ] Statement that the action is permanent or temporary.
* [ ] Expected date of first separation and schedule of separations.
* [ ] Job titles and number of employees affected.
3. Exceptions (Rare & Strict)
Use with extreme caution and legal counsel.
* [ ] Faltering Company: You were actively seeking capital that would have avoided the layoff, and notice would have ruined the deal. (Very hard to prove).
* [ ] Unforeseeable Business Circumstances: "Act of God" or sudden contract cancellation that could not be predicted 60 days ago.
* [ ] Physical Calamity: Earthquake, fire, flood.
4. CROSS-REFERENCE: HOW OTHER LAWS IMPACT CAL-WARN

4.2 LEAVE LAWS → CAL-WARN
Legal Principle: Employees on leave. Compliance Impact:

4.3 AB 692 (STAY-OR-PAY) → CAL-WARN
Legal Principle: Severance agreements. Compliance Impact:

5. Penalties
* Back Pay: You owe pay and benefits for every day the notice was late (up to 60 days).
