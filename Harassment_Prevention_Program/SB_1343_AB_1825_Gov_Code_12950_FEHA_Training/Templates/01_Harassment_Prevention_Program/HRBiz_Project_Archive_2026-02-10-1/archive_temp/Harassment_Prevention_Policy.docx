    based on protected status

    protected status

    status

-   **Termination or layoff:** Selecting for termination based on
    protected status rather than legitimate business criteria

-   **Terms and conditions of employment:** Providing different working
    conditions, benefits, or privileges based on protected status

**Examples of discrimination:**

-   Refusing to hire women for field work positions based on assumptions
    about physical capabilities

-   Paying employees of different races different salaries for
    substantially similar work

-   Denying promotion to an employee because of their age

-   Assigning less prestigious projects to employees based on national
    origin

-   Excluding an employee from client meetings because of their
    religious attire

-   Terminating an employee shortly after learning of their disability
    or medical condition

-   Denying job applicants based on criminal history without conducting
    individualized assessment

**B. Harassment (Non-Sexual)**

**Harassment** is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic
that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile,
intimidating, or offensive work environment, or that interferes with
work performance.

A **hostile work environment** exists when harassment is severe or
pervasive enough that a reasonable person would find the work
environment intimidating, hostile, or abusive, and the victim
subjectively perceives it as such.

**Prohibited harassment includes:**

***Verbal Harassment:***

-   Slurs, epithets, or derogatory comments based on protected
    characteristics

-   Offensive jokes, insults, or name-calling

-   Negative stereotyping or generalized statements about protected
    groups

-   Mocking accent, speech patterns, or language

-   Comments about physical appearance related to protected
    characteristics

-   Repeated unwelcome social invitations after clear rejection

-   Intrusive questions about protected characteristics (e.g., religious
    practices, medical conditions, immigration status, reproductive
    choices)

***Visual Harassment:***

-   Displaying or circulating offensive images, cartoons, posters, or
    graffiti

-   Sending offensive emails, text messages, or social media posts

-   Using offensive screen savers, backgrounds, or avatars

-   Making derogatory gestures

***Physical Harassment:***

-   Unwanted touching, patting, or brushing against someone

-   Assault or threats of physical harm

-   Blocking movement or cornering someone

-   Physical intimidation (standing too close, leaning over)

-   Damaging personal property based on protected status

**Examples of non-sexual harassment:**

-   Repeatedly telling jokes mocking a coworker\'s religion or religious
    practices

-   Circulating cartoons depicting racial stereotypes

-   Making repeated negative comments about older workers being \"out of
    touch\" or \"behind the times\"

-   Mocking a coworker\'s accent or asking \"where are you really
    from?\"

-   Making derogatory comments about an employee\'s pregnancy or
    suggesting they are less committed to work

-   Asking intrusive questions about an employee\'s disability or
    medical treatment

-   Commenting negatively on an employee\'s use of reproductive health
    services or reproductive loss leave

-   Excluding an employee from team activities because of their sexual
    orientation

-   Making negative comments about an employee\'s lawful off-duty
    cannabis use

-   Repeatedly asking about criminal history after hire or making
    derogatory comments about past convictions

**C. Sexual Harassment**

**Sexual harassment** is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Under
California law (Gov. Code § 12940(j)), sexual harassment includes two
types of prohibited conduct:

***1. Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment (\"This for That\")***

**Quid pro quo harassment** occurs when submission to or rejection of
sexual conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting
an individual.

**Examples:**

-   A supervisor tells an employee that a promotion depends on going on
    a date

-   A manager suggests that an employee\'s job security depends on
    tolerating sexual advances

-   A supervisor offers preferential treatment (better assignments,
    schedule, pay) in exchange for sexual favors

-   A supervisor retaliates against an employee who rejects sexual
    advances (poor performance review, demotion, termination,
    undesirable job assignment)

-   A supervisor conditions training opportunities on acceptance of
    sexual propositions

**Key point: Even a SINGLE INCIDENT of quid pro quo harassment can
violate this policy and the law.**

***2. Hostile Work Environment Sexual Harassment***

**Hostile environment sexual harassment** occurs when unwelcome sexual
conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of
employment and create an abusive work environment.

**Examples:**

**Verbal:** Sexual comments about appearance, body, or clothing; sexual
jokes or innuendos; sexually explicit stories; graphic descriptions of
sexual activities; repeated requests for dates after clear rejection;
making \"kissing\" or other sexual sounds; sexual nicknames or terms of
endearment; intrusive questions about sexual life, preferences, or
activities; discussing sexual conquests or experiences; rating
attractiveness or sexual desirability

**Visual:** Displaying sexually suggestive posters, calendars,
photographs, or screensavers; sending sexually explicit emails, texts,
memes, or images; making sexual gestures; staring or leering at body
parts; repeatedly looking someone up and down; displaying sexual content
on personal devices visible to others

**Physical:** Unwanted touching (hugging, kissing, patting, rubbing,
massaging); deliberately brushing against someone; blocking movement or
cornering; sexual assault or attempted assault; grabbing or groping

**Other:** Following someone; waiting for someone; giving unwanted gifts
of a romantic or sexual nature; love letters or notes after rejection;
repeated attempts to establish romantic relationship after clear
rejection

**Virtual/Remote Environment Examples:**

-   Sending sexually suggestive messages via Slack, Teams, email, or
    text

-   Making sexual comments during video calls about appearance,
    clothing, or home environment

-   Sharing sexually explicit content in group chats or channels

-   Making unwanted romantic advances via virtual communication

-   Commenting on body or appearance during video meetings

-   Using sexually suggestive virtual backgrounds or profile images

**Important Note:** Sexual harassment can occur between individuals of
any gender or sexual orientation. It can be committed by supervisors,
coworkers, clients, vendors, or any other person in connection with
work.

**D. Retaliation**

**Retaliation** is any adverse action taken against an individual
because they engaged in protected activity.

***Protected Activities Include:***

-   **Reporting** discrimination, harassment, or other violations
    (internally or to external agencies)

-   **Filing a complaint** with the California Civil Rights Department
    (CRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or other
    government agency

-   **Participating in an investigation** (as complainant, witness, or
    investigator)

-   **Opposing unlawful practices** (objecting to discriminatory
    conduct, refusing to follow discriminatory orders)

-   **Requesting reasonable accommodation** for disability or religious
    practice

-   **Taking protected leave** (FMLA, CFRA, sick leave, pregnancy
    disability leave, reproductive loss leave)

-   **Requesting lactation breaks or accommodation**

-   **Filing a workers\' compensation claim**

-   **Whistleblowing** (reporting violations of law, regulation, or
    public policy)

-   **Engaging in union activity or protected concerted activity**

***Forms of Retaliation (Examples):***

-   Termination, demotion, suspension, or other disciplinary action

-   Denial of promotion, training, or advancement opportunities

-   Negative or unjustified performance review

-   Undesirable job assignment, transfer, or schedule change

-   Reduction in hours, pay, or benefits

-   Increased scrutiny, micromanagement, or unrealistic performance
    standards

-   Exclusion from meetings, projects, or communications

-   Hostile treatment, shunning, or social isolation

-   Threats or intimidation

-   Spreading rumors or making false statements

-   Creating obstacles to performance (withholding resources,
    information, or support)

**Critical Point: Retaliation is independently unlawful even if the
underlying harassment or discrimination complaint is found to be
unsubstantiated. Making a GOOD-FAITH COMPLAINT is protected, even if the
investigation does not find a violation.**

**E. Inappropriate Conduct**

Beyond conduct that violates the law, Sapphos
discourages **inappropriate workplace conduct** that, while not
necessarily severe or pervasive enough to constitute illegal harassment,
is unprofessional and inconsistent with our values of respect and
dignity.

**Examples of inappropriate conduct:**

-   Off-color jokes or comments (even if not directed at protected
    characteristic)

-   Persistent unwelcome social invitations after polite decline

-   Comments on physical appearance unrelated to work (even if not
    sexual)

-   Gossip or rumors about coworkers\' personal lives

-   Exclusionary behavior or cliques that make coworkers feel unwelcome

-   Condescending or dismissive treatment

-   Yelling, cursing, or aggressive communication

**Employees who experience or witness inappropriate conduct are
encouraged to report it** so the Company can address issues before they
escalate to unlawful harassment. Reports of inappropriate conduct will
be handled confidentially and addressed through coaching, counseling, or
other appropriate measures.

**V. REPORTING PROCEDURES**

**A. Duty to Report**

**All employees are strongly encouraged to report** any conduct that
violates this policy or that they believe may violate this policy. **You
do not need to be certain** that a violation has occurred. If you
experience, witness, or become aware of conduct that may be
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, please report it.

Early reporting allows the Company to investigate and address issues
before they become severe.

**B. Multiple Reporting Channels -- No Chain of Command Required**

Sapphos provides **multiple channels** for reporting harassment,
discrimination, and retaliation. **You are NOT required to report to
your immediate supervisor**, especially if your supervisor is the
alleged harasser or you are uncomfortable reporting to them.

**You may report to any of the following:**

                           *Note: While the Company accepts anonymous
                           complaints, our ability to fully investigate
                           may be limited if we cannot contact you for
                           additional information.*
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

***How to Make a Report:***

Reports may be made:

-   **Verbally** (in person, by phone, or via video call)

-   **In writing** (email, letter, or complaint form)

-   **Anonymously** \[if mechanism available\]

You do not need to use any particular format or form. Simply describe:

-   What happened (the conduct that concerns you)

-   When it happened (dates and times if possible)

-   Where it happened (location, including virtual platforms if
    applicable)

-   Who was involved (alleged harasser, witnesses)

-   Any other relevant information (prior incidents, evidence such as
    emails or messages)

All reports will be taken seriously and investigated promptly.

**C. External Agency Filing**

**You have the right to file a complaint with government agencies** at
any time, without first reporting to Sapphos. Filing with an external
agency does not prevent the Company from conducting its own internal
investigation.

                                      incident (for dual-filed charges with CRD)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**You cannot be retaliated against for filing a complaint with CRD or
EEOC.**

**D. Supervisor and Manager Mandatory Reporting Duty**

**All supervisors and managers have a mandatory duty to report** any
harassment, discrimination, or retaliation they:

-   **Witness directly**

-   **Are told about** by an employee (even if the employee asks them to
    keep it confidential)

-   **Become aware of** through any means

**Supervisors must report immediately** (same business day if possible)
to the EEO Officer at \[PLACEHOLDER: EEO_OFFICER_CONTACT\].

**Supervisors CANNOT promise confidentiality** to an employee making a
complaint. If an employee asks you to keep a complaint confidential, you
must explain:

*\"I understand this is difficult, but I am required by Company policy
to report this to our EEO Officer. The investigation will be handled as
confidentially as possible, but I cannot promise complete
confidentiality because the Company has a duty to investigate.\"*

**Failure to report is a violation of this policy and may result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination.**

**Why this matters:** Under California law (Gov. Code § 12940(j)),
supervisors can be held **personally liable** for harassment.
Additionally, the Company can be held liable for harassment by
supervisors that it knew or should have known about. Immediate reporting
protects employees, supervisors, and the Company.

**VI. INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES**

**A. Company\'s Commitment to Prompt Investigation**

Sapphos is committed to conducting a **prompt, fair, thorough, and
impartial investigation** of all harassment, discrimination, and
retaliation complaints.

**Upon receiving a complaint, the Company will:**

1.  **Acknowledge receipt** of the complaint to the complainant

2.  **Assess severity** and implement interim protective measures if
    necessary

3.  **Assign a qualified investigator** (internal or external)

4.  **Conduct a thorough investigation**

5.  **Reach a determination** based on the evidence

6.  **Take appropriate remedial action** if violations are found

7.  **Notify** the complainant and respondent of the outcome (in general
    terms)
