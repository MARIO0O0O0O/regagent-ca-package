# Government Filing Rights
Employees may file complaints externally with:
• CA Civil Rights Department (calcivilrights.ca.gov / 800-884-1684) – Usually within 3 years of last incident
• EEOC (eeoc.gov / 800-669-4000) – 300 days in CA
CRD and EEOC share jurisdiction; dual-filing protects employee rights.
