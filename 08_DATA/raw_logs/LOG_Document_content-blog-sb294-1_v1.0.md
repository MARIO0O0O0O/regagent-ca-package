## What is SB 294?

Senate Bill 294, signed into law in 2023 and effective February 1, 2026, requires California employers to provide an annual "Know Your Rights" notice to all employees. The law aims to ensure workers understand their workplace rights and how to report violations.

### Key Features:
- **Annual distribution** (every February 1st)
- **Written acknowledgment** required from employees
- **Multilingual requirements** (must provide in employee's language)
- **Emergency contact opt-in** system
- **Strict recordkeeping** requirements

### Why This Matters for LA Businesses

Los Angeles has one of the most diverse workforces in the country. SB 294's language requirements mean you'll likely need notices in multiple languages—at minimum, English and Spanish. The emergency contact provision also creates new data privacy considerations.

---

## Who Must Comply?

**ALL California employers must comply**, regardless of size. This includes:

✅ Businesses with 1+ employees
✅ Nonprofits
✅ Government entities
✅ Temporary staffing agencies
✅ Gig economy platforms (for W-2 employees)

### Special Considerations:

**Multi-location businesses:** Each California location must distribute notices.

**Remote workers:** Employees working remotely for California companies must receive the notice electronically.

**Seasonal employees:** Must receive notice upon hire or by February 1 if employed during that period.

---

## What Does the Notice Include?

The "Know Your Rights" notice must cover these topics:

### 1. Wage and Hour Rights
- Minimum wage (state and local)
- Overtime requirements
- Meal and rest break rights
- Pay stub requirements
- Final paycheck rules

### 2. Discrimination and Harassment
- Protected classes under FEHA
- How to file complaints
- Retaliation protections
- Resources for victims

### 3. Health and Safety
- Cal/OSHA rights
- Workplace injury reporting
- COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave
- Workplace violence prevention (SB 553)

### 4. Leave Rights
- Paid Sick Leave (PSL)
- California Family Rights Act (CFRA)
- Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL)
- Crime victim leave
- Voting leave

### 5. Reporting Violations
- How to file wage claims
- PAGA notice requirements
- Whistleblower protections
- Contact information for enforcement agencies

### Language Requirements

The notice must be provided in:
- English (always required)
- Any language spoken by at least 10% of your workforce
- Spanish (for LA businesses, this is almost always required)

**Pro Tip:** The California Labor Commissioner's website provides official translations. Don't create your own—use the state-approved versions.

---

## Distribution Requirements

### Timing
- **Initial Distribution:** February 1, 2026
- **New Hires:** Within 7 days of starting work
- **Annual Distribution:** Every February 1st thereafter

### Methods of Distribution

**Acceptable methods:**
1. Physical copy with signed acknowledgment
2. Email with electronic acknowledgment
3. Posted on company intranet with tracking
4. Included in employee handbook (with separate acknowledgment)

**NOT acceptable:**
- Posting on a bulletin board alone
- Verbal notification
- Assuming prior notification suffices

### Acknowledgment Requirements

Employees must:
1. Confirm receipt in writing
2. Acknowledge they understand their rights
3. Indicate their preferred language

**Sample Acknowledgment Language:**
```
I acknowledge that I have received and read the Workplace Know Your Rights 
notice dated February 1, 2026. I understand my workplace rights and know 
how to report violations. I prefer to receive future notices in: [Language]

Employee Signature: _______________ Date: _______________
```

## Emergency Contact Collection

**New Requirement:** By March 30, 2026, employers must offer employees the option to provide emergency contact information.

### Important Details:

**Opt-In Only:** Employees can decline without penalty.

**Information Requested:**
- Name of emergency contact
- Relationship to employee
- Phone number(s)
- Any special instructions

**Privacy Protections:**
- Must be stored securely (not in personnel files accessible to supervisors)
- Can only be accessed in emergencies
- Cannot be used for marketing or other purposes
- Must be updated at employee's request

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create secure storage system
2. Distribute opt-in forms by February 1, 2026
3. Collect completed forms by March 30, 2026
4. Train HR staff on access protocols
5. Establish process for updates

**Sample Opt-In Form:**
```
VOLUNTARY EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION

You may provide emergency contact information for use in workplace 
emergencies. This is voluntary—you may decline without consequence.

Emergency Contact Name: _____________________
Relationship: _____________________
Primary Phone: _____________________
Alternate Phone: _____________________
Special Instructions: _____________________

☐ I choose to provide this information
☐ I decline to provide this information

Employee Signature: _______________ Date: _______________
```

## Record Keeping

Maintain records for **at least 3 years** from the date of distribution:

**Required Records:**
- Copies of notices distributed
- Signed acknowledgments from all employees
- Date and method of distribution
- Language version provided
- Emergency contact opt-in forms

**Best Practices:**
1. Create digital backup of all acknowledgments
2. Store in secure, separate file from personnel records
3. Track non-responders and follow up
4. Document follow-up attempts
5. Note terminations before acknowledgment received

**Audit Tip:** During a Cal/OSHA or DLSE investigation, these records are the first thing inspectors request. Missing documentation = assumed violation.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

### Civil Penalties

**Labor Commissioner Penalties:**
- $500 per employee (first offense)
- $750+ per employee (repeat violations within 3 years)

**Example:** A 20-person business failing to distribute notices faces $10,000 in penalties for first offense.

### PAGA Exposure

SB 294 violations can trigger PAGA (Private Attorneys General Act) lawsuits:
- $100 per employee per pay period (initial violation)
- $200 per employee per pay period (subsequent violations)
- **Plus:** Attorney fees paid by employer

**Real-World Example:** A 50-person business with 26 pay periods could face $130,000 in penalties ($100 × 50 employees × 26 pay periods) for failing to distribute notices for one year.

### Reputational Damage

Beyond financial penalties:
- Negative media coverage
- Employee morale issues
- Difficulty recruiting
- Customer perception problems

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if an employee refuses to sign the acknowledgment?

Document the refusal in writing. Note the date, time, and witness. While you can't force an employee to sign, California law doesn't require employee cooperation for the employer to be compliant—you must offer the notice and make reasonable efforts to obtain acknowledgment.

### Can I include the SB 294 notice in my employee handbook?

Yes, but you must obtain a separate acknowledgment specifically for the SB 294 notice. A general "I received the handbook" acknowledgment is not sufficient.

### What if I have remote employees in other states?

Only California-based employees (those working in California or remotely for California employers) require the SB 294 notice.

### How do I know which languages to provide?

Survey your workforce or review demographic data. If 10% or more speak a language other than English, provide the notice in that language. For Los Angeles businesses, Spanish is almost always required.

### Can I email the notice instead of printing?

Yes, electronic distribution is acceptable if:
1. Employees have regular access to email at work
2. You can track when the email was opened
3. You obtain electronic acknowledgment
4. You can prove receipt if challenged

### What happens if an employee is on leave on February 1?

Provide the notice upon their return and collect acknowledgment then. Document the reason for delayed distribution.
