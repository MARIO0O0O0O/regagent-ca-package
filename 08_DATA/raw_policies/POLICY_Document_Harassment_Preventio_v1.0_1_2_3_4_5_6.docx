to strict compliance obligations under California law.

**III. QUALIFIED TRAINERS - WHO CAN PROCTOR THE TRAINING**

Trainers must be qualified to teach the course content. According to 2
CCR § 11024(d)(5), trainers must satisfy at least one of the following:

**Option 1: Internal staff**

At least two (2) years of practical experience in one or more of the
following areas:

-   The design or provision of training in employment discrimination,
    retaliation, sexual harassment prevention, or related content

-   The provision of advice to employers or employees regarding
    employment discrimination, retaliation, or sexual harassment

-   The investigation of employment discrimination, retaliation, or
    sexual harassment complaints

-   The adjudication or other resolution of employment discrimination,
    retaliation, or sexual harassment complaints

-   The study of employment discrimination, retaliation, or sexual
    harassment prevention

**Option 2: Educational Qualifications**

-   A law degree (J.D. or LL.B.)

-   A degree or credential from a law school or institution of higher
    learning in a related field (e.g., human resources, organizational
    psychology, conflict resolution)

    experience

-   Professional training consultants specializing in harassment
    prevention

-   Academic professors in relevant fields

-   Certified HR professionals (SHRM-CP, SHRM-SCP, PHR, SPHR) with
    qualifying experience

-   In-house HR staff meeting the qualification requirements

-   Third-party vendors whose trainers meet the standards

**Important Note:** The trainer does not need to be an attorney, but
must meet the experience or educational qualifications outlined above.

**IV. POLICY BEFORE TRAINING - SEQUENCING REQUIREMENT**

**Analysis**

**Question:** Must the written anti-harassment policy be in place before
training can be provided?

**Answer:** The statute and regulations do not explicitly mandate that
the policy must be implemented before training. However, **best practice
strongly recommends distributing the policy before or concurrent with
training given that it must cover Employers Complaint Procedures.
Without the existence of an approved Complaint procedure we cannot
complete a comprehensive course.**

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Training Content Requirement:** The training must include \"a
    description of the employer\'s complaint process\" (2 CCR §
    11024(d)(3)(D)). This requires that a complaint process exists and
    has been documented in a written policy.

2.  **Practical Effectiveness:** Employees receiving training will be
    instructed to report harassment through the employer\'s complaint
    procedures. If no policy exists, the training lacks a critical
    practical component.

3.  **Regulatory Intent:** The regulations contemplate that employees
    will have access to the policy and complaint procedures as part of
    their training and ongoing employment.

4.  **Legal Risk Mitigation:** Providing training without a
    corresponding policy could be viewed as incomplete compliance and
    may not provide the legal protections intended by the statute.

**Recommendation:**

**The written anti-harassment policy should be distributed to all
employees before or at the time training is conducted.** This ensures:

-   Full compliance with the spirit and letter of the law

-   Employees have immediate access to reporting procedures discussed in
    training

-   Maximum legal protection for the organization

-   Coherent implementation of the harassment prevention program

**V. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES**

**Civil Rights Department Authority**

The California Civil Rights Department (formerly DFEH) has authority to:

-   Investigating complaints of failure to provide required training

-   Seek compliance through administrative proceedings

-   Issue findings and recommendations

**Authority:** Cal. Gov. Code § 12930

**Evidentiary Use**

While failure to provide training does not create an independent private
right of action, such failure can be introduced as evidence in
harassment, discrimination, or retaliation cases to demonstrate:

-   Inadequate preventive measures

-   Failure to exercise reasonable care

-   Employer negligence

This can significantly impact employer liability in harassment cases.

**Employer Liability Implications**

Under the California Supreme Court\'s decision in *State Dep\'t of
Health Servs. v. Superior Court*, 31 Cal.4th 1026 (2003), employers can
raise an affirmative defense to harassment claims by showing they:

1.  Took reasonable steps to prevent harassment, and

2.  Promptly corrected harassment when it occurred

**Failure to provide required training undermines this defense.**

**VI. IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**

To ensure full compliance with California\'s harassment prevention
training requirements, the organization must complete the following
steps:

**Phase 1: Policy Development and Distribution**

-   Draft comprehensive anti-harassment policy meeting all requirements
    of 2 CCR § 11023

-   Include all protected categories under FEHA

-   Establish multiple complaint reporting channels

-   Include Civil Rights Department contact information

-   Translate policy into languages spoken by 10%+ of workforce

-   Distribute policy to all current employees

-   Post policy in conspicuous workplace locations

-   Make policy available on company intranet/employee portal

**Phase 2: Trainer Selection**

-   Identify and vet qualified trainers meeting requirements of 2 CCR §
    11024(d)(5)

-   Verify trainer credentials and experience

-   Review training curriculum for compliance with mandatory content

-   Ensure training is interactive with Q&A opportunities

**Phase 3: Training Delivery**

-   Schedule 2-hour training sessions for all supervisory employees

-   Schedule 1-hour training sessions for all nonsupervisory employees

-   Ensure training covers all mandatory content areas per 2 CCR §
    11024(d)

-   Provide make-up sessions for absent employees

-   Establish protocol for training new hires within 6 months

**Phase 4: Documentation and Recordkeeping**

-   Collect and maintain sign-in sheets/attendance records

-   Retain copies of all training materials

-   Document trainer qualifications

-   Create tracking system for 2-year training cycle

-   Store records securely for minimum 2 years

-   Establish calendar reminders for recurring training

**Phase 5: Ongoing Compliance**

-   Add harassment prevention training to onboarding process

-   Create supervisor promotion training protocol

-   Establish biennial training schedule for all employees

-   Review and update policy annually

-   Monitor changes in law and regulations

-   Conduct periodic compliance audits

**VII. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS**

**Multi-State Employers**

If the organization has employees in multiple states, ensure
California-specific training for California-based employees, as
California\'s requirements exceed federal standards and those of most
other states.

**Remote and Telecommuting Employees**

California employees working remotely (including from out of state) must
receive the same training as on-site employees. Online interactive
training is permissible and appropriate for remote workers.

**Temporary and Seasonal Workers**

Temporary and seasonal employees count toward the 5-employee threshold
and must receive training if employed for more than six months.

**Supervisory Definition**

\"Supervisory employee\" includes anyone with authority to hire,
transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward,
or discipline other employees, or to adjust their grievances, or
effectively recommend such action. 2 CCR § 11024(c).

**VIII. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

California\'s harassment prevention training law imposes comprehensive
obligations on employers. Our organization must ensure full compliance
through:

1.  **Immediate Development and Distribution** of a compliant written
    anti-harassment policy

2.  **Engagement of Qualified Trainers** meeting regulatory standards

3.  **Timely Delivery** of interactive training to all supervisory (2
    hours) and nonsupervisory (1 hour) employees

4.  **Proper Documentation** and recordkeeping for minimum 2-year
    retention

5.  **Ongoing Compliance** with biennial training cycles and new hire
    requirements

**Recommended Timeline:**

-   **Weeks 1-2:** Finalize written policy; distribute to all employees

-   **Weeks 3-4:** Engage qualified trainer; schedule training sessions

-   **Weeks 5-8:** Conduct all initial training; document completion

-   **Ongoing:** Implement new hire training protocol; establish
    biennial calendar

The policy and training should be implemented simultaneously to ensure
legal compliance, practical effectiveness, and maximum protection for
the organization.
