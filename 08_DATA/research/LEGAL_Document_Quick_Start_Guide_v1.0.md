## COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: AI Left Placeholders

**Example:** Policy still says "[COMPANY NAME]" instead of your name

**Fix:**
```
You left [COMPANY NAME] as a placeholder. Please replace ALL 
instances with "ABC Company Inc."

Also replace:
- [HR EMAIL] with hr@abccompany.com
- [PHONE] with (555) 123-4567

Update the entire document and regenerate.
```

---

### Issue: Examples Don't Fit Your Industry

**Example:** Policy mentions retail examples but you run a restaurant

**Fix:**
```
Please update all examples to be specific to a restaurant/food 
service business. For instance:

- Instead of "retail theft," use "customer disputes"
- Instead of "cash registers," use "servers handling tips"
- Add examples about kitchen environment
- Add examples about late-night closing

Regenerate the policy with restaurant-specific examples.
```

---

### Issue: Too Much Legal Jargon

**Fix:**
```
This policy uses too much legal language. Please rewrite using 
8th-grade reading level. Replace:

- "Pursuant to" with "According to"
- "Notwithstanding" with "Even if"
- "Heretofore" with "before this"
- Remove Latin phrases

Regenerate in plain English.
```

---

### Issue: Missing a Section

**Fix:**
```
Please add a section about:
- Social media harassment
- Remote work harassment
- Third-party harassment (customers)

Insert these after Section [X] and regenerate the complete policy.
```

---

### Issue: Want Multiple Language Versions

**Fix:**
```
Please generate a Spanish version of this policy. Maintain the 
same structure and formatting. Ensure the translation is accurate 
for workplace compliance purposes.
```

---

## ADVANCED TIPS

### Get Multiple Policy Versions

**For different risk levels:**
```
Generate 3 versions of this policy:
1. Minimum compliance (meets legal requirements only)
2. Standard (adds some best practices)
3. Comprehensive (includes all recommended elements)

Label each clearly.
```

---

### Get Summary Documents

**After generating full policy:**
```
Now create these supplemental documents:

1. One-page summary for new employee orientation
2. Manager quick reference guide (2 pages)
3. FAQ for employees (10 most common questions)
4. Training outline (1 hour session agenda)

Use the same company information.
