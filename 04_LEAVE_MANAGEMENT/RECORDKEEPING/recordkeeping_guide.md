## RETENTION SCHEDULE

| Record Type | Form | Minimum Retention | Storage Location |
|-------------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| CFRA/FMLA leave requests and approvals | LEAVE-FORM-001 | 3 years | Confidential medical file |
| PDL requests and approvals | LEAVE-FORM-002 | 3 years | Confidential medical file |
| SB 848 leave records | LEAVE-FORM-003 | 3 years | Confidential medical file |
| Medical certifications (all leave types) | Provider docs | 3 years | Confidential medical file |
| Leave designation notices | LEAVE-FORM-004 | 3 years | Confidential medical file |
| Interactive process documentation | LEAVE-FORM-005 | Employment + 4 years | Confidential HR file |
| PSL accrual and usage records | Payroll | 3 years | Payroll records |
| Leave training records | LEAVE-FORM-006 | 3 years + per SB 513 | Personnel file |

## FILE ARCHITECTURE — THE THREE-FILE RULE

California law requires separation of medical information from standard personnel records.

### File 1: Standard Personnel File
- Job applications, offer letters, performance reviews, disciplinary records, training records
- **Does NOT contain:** medical certifications, leave request forms, disability information, SB 848 records

### File 2: Confidential Medical File
- All CFRA/FMLA/PDL/SB 848 request forms
- All medical certifications and healthcare provider documentation
- Workers' comp medical records
- ADA/FEHA accommodation documentation
- **Access:** HR only; management receives schedule information only, never medical details

### File 3: Payroll Records
- PSL accrual and usage
- Pay rate, hours, timekeeping records
- SDI/PFL election and coordination records

---

## CONFIDENTIALITY RULES

**What supervisors may be told:**
- Whether the employee is on approved leave (yes/no)
- Expected return date (if known)
- Any scheduling restrictions or accommodations needed upon return

**What supervisors may NOT be told:**
- Diagnosis or nature of condition
- Medical details of any kind
- Why the employee is on leave (beyond "approved protected leave")
- Whether the leave is CFRA, PDL, or SB 848 (especially for SB 848 — reproductive loss is highly sensitive)

**Finance / Payroll may be told:**
- Leave status (active/inactive) for payroll purposes
- Whether the employee is eligible for SDI supplement
- Expected return date

**Finance / Payroll may NOT be told:**
- Diagnosis, condition, or leave reason
- Medical certification details

---

## PSL RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS

Under Labor Code § 246(j), employers must:
- Track PSL accrual, use, and balance for each employee
- Show PSL balance on each pay stub (or separate document accompanying pay)
- Retain PSL records for 3 years

**Pay stub must show:**
- Hours of PSL accrued during the pay period
- Total accrued PSL balance available

---

## SB 848 SPECIAL CONFIDENTIALITY

Reproductive loss leave records are subject to heightened confidentiality:
- File ONLY in the confidential medical file
- Do not reference in performance reviews, attendance records, or personnel file
- The reason for the leave (miscarriage, failed IVF, etc.) is never disclosed to management
- Supervisors are informed of schedule impact only
