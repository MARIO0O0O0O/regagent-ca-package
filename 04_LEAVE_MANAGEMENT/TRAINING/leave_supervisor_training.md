## MODULE 1 — THE LEAVE LANDSCAPE: WHAT SUPERVISORS MUST KNOW
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[OPEN — Say:]**

"California has some of the most extensive leave protections of any state in the country. As supervisors, you sit at the front line of leave administration — and how you handle leave requests can either protect the company or expose it to significant liability. Today we're going to equip you to handle leave situations correctly."

---

**[THE CORE PRINCIPLE — Say:]**

"Here is the single most important rule for supervisors:

**When you become aware of information that suggests an employee may be entitled to leave, you must act on that information — even if the employee hasn't used the magic words.**

An employee who says 'I need time off to have surgery' has not said 'I am requesting CFRA leave.' But you now know enough to start the leave process. Failure to do so is a violation of the employee's rights — and the company's liability."

---

**[SUPERVISOR'S FIVE OBLIGATIONS — Cover each:]**

1. **Recognize** when a leave-qualifying reason may exist
2. **Notify HR immediately** — your job is to flag it, not to make the call alone
3. **Never deny or discourage** leave use — even informally
4. **Never retaliate** — directly or subtly — for leave use
5. **Never count** protected leave in attendance systems, point systems, or performance reviews

"You are not expected to know all the details of leave law. That's what HR is for. Your job is to recognize the trigger, pass it to HR, and stay hands-off while the process plays out."

---

**[RETALIATION — Concrete examples — Say:]**

"Let me be specific about what retaliation looks like in the leave context, because it often doesn't look like obvious retaliation:

- Saying to a team member: 'You've been out a lot — is this going to be a problem?'
- Giving someone a lower performance rating because they 'weren't here' during a project
- Scheduling the less desirable shifts for someone who returns from leave
- Commenting on their absence to coworkers
- Denying a promotion because of concerns about future availability

All of these can be the basis of a successful CFRA or FMLA retaliation claim. When in doubt — call HR."

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Let's go through the specific laws you need to understand."

---

## MODULE 2 — CFRA, FMLA, AND PDL
*[20 minutes]*

---

**[CFRA — The Big Picture — Say:]**

"The California Family Rights Act — CFRA — is the primary leave law you'll encounter. Since 2021, it applies to any employer with **5 or more employees**. That means if you're a supervisor here, CFRA applies to your team."

**CFRA eligibility checklist — employees must have:**
- 12 months with the company *(need not be consecutive)*
- 1,250 hours in the preceding 12 months
- Work at a location with 5+ employees within 75 miles

"When these three boxes are checked, the employee has **12 weeks of job-protected leave per year** for:
- Their own serious health condition
- A serious health condition of a covered family member
- Baby bonding within 12 months of birth, adoption, or foster placement
- Qualifying military exigency"

---

**[CFRA Family Members — a WIDE list — Say:]**

"CFRA covers a broad family definition — much broader than federal FMLA. Covered family members include:
- Spouse or domestic partner
- Child — biological, adopted, foster, step, or legal ward — **at any age** and **regardless of whether they're dependent**
- Parent (including step and in-laws)
- Grandparent, grandchild, sibling

If an employee needs time off to care for their adult sibling with cancer — that qualifies under CFRA. If they need time to care for their grandchild — that qualifies."

---

**[PDL — Separate, More Protective — Say:]**

"Pregnancy Disability Leave is a completely separate entitlement. It applies to employers with 5+ employees and has **no minimum service requirement** — an employee hired yesterday is eligible for PDL.

PDL covers up to **4 months** of disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions — including:
- Prenatal appointments and morning sickness
- Gestational diabetes, preeclampsia
- Postpartum recovery and postpartum depression
- Pregnancy loss / miscarriage

The key thing for supervisors: **PDL does not run at the same time as CFRA.** They are sequential. We'll cover that in the next module."

---

**[THE NOTICE TRIGGER — Say:]**

"When does an employee trigger leave rights? The moment they communicate information suggesting a qualifying reason — regardless of whether they formally request leave.

Triggers you should flag to HR:
- 'I need to be out for a surgery'
- 'My mom is in the hospital and I need to help her'
- 'I'm pregnant and having complications'
- 'My kid is sick and I need to take them to the doctor'
- A pattern of absences you know or suspect is related to a health condition

Flag it. Let HR make the call."

---

**[MEDICAL CERTIFICATION — Say:]**

"Once HR designates the leave as CFRA or FMLA, the employee can be asked to provide medical certification within **15 calendar days**. This is HR's process to manage — but supervisors should know:

- You do NOT ask for the diagnosis. You do not get to know the specific condition.
- You may receive information like: 'Employee needs intermittent leave up to 2 days per week for a chronic condition.'
- You do NOT get to call the doctor, second-guess the certification, or demand more information.

When you get the certification: adjust the schedule as described, and call HR if you have operational questions."

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Now the most complex part — leave chaining."

---

## MODULE 3 — LEAVE CHAINING: THE PREGNANCY SEQUENCE
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"Leave chaining is what happens when multiple protected leaves occur in sequence. The most common and most complex scenario involves pregnancy. Let's walk through it."

---

**[THE CHAIN — Step by step:]**

"An employee tells you she's pregnant. She's been here for a year and works full-time. Here's what the legal timeline looks like:

**Step 1: Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL) — begins when she becomes disabled**
- Starts when pregnancy-related disability begins — could be during pregnancy (severe morning sickness, bed rest) or postpartum
- Can be up to **4 months**
- Available from Day 1 of employment
- SDI pays roughly 60-70% of wages during this time
- Her job is protected; yours is to coordinate with HR and ensure the position stays available

**Step 2: CFRA Baby Bonding — begins when PDL ends**
- After PDL ends, she's entitled to up to **12 weeks of CFRA bonding leave**
- This leave is for bonding — it's not dependent on disability
- SDI transitions to PFL, which also pays 60-70% of wages for up to 8 weeks
- Her job is still protected

**Total result:** Up to approximately 7 months of job-protected leave. Not a surprise — this is the law. Plan for it."

---

**[THE AUGMENTATION PRINCIPLE — Say:]**

"Here's the critical point that trips up managers: exhausting leave does not automatically mean you can terminate.

California courts — specifically *Sanchez v. Swissport* — have held that if an employee is still disabled when their statutory leave runs out, the employer must engage in an **interactive process** and consider **additional leave as a reasonable accommodation**.

What this means in practice:
- When an employee's PDL or CFRA is approaching exhaustion, HR should reach out to understand the employee's situation
- Do not send a termination letter on the day leave runs out
- Do not make assumptions about whether the employee is returning
- Talk to HR — they will lead the interactive process

The interactive process requirement applies any time an employee may need an accommodation for a disability. It's not just for leave."

---

**[QUICK SCENARIO — Ask:]**

"An employee is on PDL for pregnancy complications. Her initial certification said 8 weeks. Week 8 arrives and her doctor submits a new note extending the leave by 4 more weeks. What do you do?"

*[Allow response. Correct: Contact HR. The extension likely qualifies — HR reviews the new certification and continues the leave. Do not deny it unilaterally.]*

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Let's run through some trickier scenarios."

---

## MODULE 4 — SCENARIO WORKSHOP
*[20 minutes]*

---

**[Say:]** "I'm going to walk through four situations. For each one, tell me: what should you do, and what should you avoid?"

---

**Scenario 1: The Intermittent Leave Problem**

"Marcus has approved intermittent FMLA/CFRA leave for migraines — up to 2 days per month. He's taken 1–2 days per month for 3 months, always on Mondays or Fridays. Your team is frustrated because it feels like he's extending weekends. What do you do?"

*[Discuss. Key points:]*
- The pattern alone does not invalidate the leave — intermittent leave can fall on weekends-adjacent days
- You may note the pattern and report to HR, who may seek recertification if there is objective reason to doubt the legitimacy
- You may NOT discipline, comment, or adjust Marcus's schedule to make Mondays/Fridays undesirable
- You should not say anything to the team about his absences
- HR can request recertification every 30 days (or sooner if there's genuine reason to doubt) — not you

---

**Scenario 2: The New Employee Request**

"Brianna started 3 months ago. She approaches you and says she needs 6 weeks off because her mother has been diagnosed with cancer and needs daily care. What do you do?"

*[Discuss. Key points:]*
- She does not yet meet CFRA's 12-month/1,250-hour eligibility requirements
- However, California PSL covers care for a parent — she may use accrued PSL
- Notify HR regardless — HR should assess whether any other protections apply
- If she exhausts PSL, her leave may be unpaid and unprotected — but HR should communicate this to her, not you
- Never tell an employee they "don't qualify" for leave without checking with HR first

---

**Scenario 3: The Abuse Suspicion**

"Kevin calls in sick frequently. You've noticed he seems fine on the days he calls in, and his coworkers have made comments. You suspect he's gaming the system. What do you do?"

*[Discuss. Key points:]*
- Suspicion is not a basis for denying leave or taking disciplinary action
- Document the pattern objectively — dates, frequency, any information provided
- Report to HR — HR may request recertification or a fitness-for-duty exam in appropriate circumstances
- Never accuse Kevin directly or suggest he's lying
- If his absences do not qualify for protected leave, HR will manage the attendance issue — you should not act unilaterally
- Be equally vigilant for your own biases: employees with chronic conditions often have unpredictable patterns that look like abuse to supervisors unfamiliar with those conditions

---

**Scenario 4: Return from Leave**

"Danielle returns from 12 weeks of CFRA leave for a serious health condition. Her position was filled by a temp who has been doing an excellent job. Your instinct is to move Danielle to a different role that's 'more appropriate for her current capacity.' Is this okay?"

*[Discuss. Key points:]*
- No. Danielle is entitled to her **same position** — not a different one, not a lower one, not one you think is a better fit for her
- The temp must be let go, or the temp can be offered a different role
- If the same position genuinely no longer exists due to a legitimate business reason unrelated to her leave, consult HR before taking any action
- 'More appropriate for her capacity' language suggests disability-based decision-making — FEHA violation risk
- Any concerns about her work performance after return must be addressed the same way you'd address any performance issue — through standard performance management, not leave-related adjustment

---

## MODULE 5 — PSL, SB 848, AND OTHER LEAVES
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[PSL — Key Supervisor Points:]**

"California's paid sick leave law is simpler from a supervisor's standpoint — but here are the things you must know:

- Employees can use PSL for their own illness, to care for covered family members, domestic violence situations, and now — as of 2026 — to attend judicial proceedings as a crime victim
- You may NOT require an employee to find their own replacement before using PSL
- You may NOT discipline or negatively evaluate an employee for using PSL
- You may NOT refuse to allow PSL use to an eligible employee
- You do not get to know the reason unless the employee volunteers it — and even then, you do not document the reason in a way that could be used against them later"

---

**[SB 848 — Reproductive Loss Leave:]**

"SB 848, effective January 1, 2024, creates a protected leave for reproductive loss — miscarriage, failed IVF, failed adoption or surrogacy, stillbirth.

Up to 5 days per qualifying event, with a maximum of 20 days per year if multiple events occur.

The most important thing for you as a supervisor:
- This is deeply sensitive. The employee is experiencing a profound loss.
- When an employee comes to you — or when HR tells you an employee is using this leave — your response is human care and operational coverage planning. Nothing else.
- You do NOT ask about the nature of the loss.
- You do NOT ask when they're coming back if the timing falls within the 5-day entitlement.
- You DO tell HR immediately."

---

**[TRANSITION + CLOSE:]**
"One more thing before questions: your best tool in any leave situation is to involve HR early and document everything. If HR isn't involved and you made a call on your own — that's when liability happens."

---

## MODULE 6 — Q&A + SIGN-IN
*[10 minutes]*

---

**Common questions and prepared answers:**

**"What if a leave request is clearly fraudulent?"**  
"Document what you observe — dates, behavior, any factual information. Report it to HR with your documentation. HR manages the response, which may include requesting recertification or a fitness-for-duty exam. You do not confront the employee directly or deny the leave without going through HR."

**"What about small teams — I can't cover for months of absence?"**  
"I understand the operational challenge. The law doesn't carve out hardship exceptions for small teams on CFRA eligibility. However, there are some operational tools: temp workers, redistribution of duties, or intermittent scheduling arrangements. HR can help you think through coverage. The employee's leave rights, though, cannot be conditioned on your ability to cover."

**"If I suspect an employee is taking intermittent leave just to get out of meetings, what can I do?"**  
"Document the pattern, bring it to HR. If there is genuine objective reason to doubt a certification, HR can request recertification. But suspicion alone isn't enough — you need actual facts, not just the inconvenience of their pattern."

**"Can I text or email an employee while they're on leave?"**  
"For logistical questions directly related to their return — yes, briefly. For work tasks — no, unless they have agreed to remain available and are being compensated. If you're regularly contacting an employee on leave about work, that's a problem. Check with HR on any ongoing contact."
