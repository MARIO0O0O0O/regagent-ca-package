## 1. RESPONSIBLE PERSON

**IIPP Program Administrator:**

Name: [FULL NAME]  
Title: [JOB TITLE]  
Phone: [PHONE]  
Email: [EMAIL]  
Location: [OFFICE / SITE]

**Alternate / Backup:**

Name: [FULL NAME]

Phone: [PHONE]

**Responsibilities of the Program Administrator:**
- Develop, implement, and maintain this IIPP
- Conduct or coordinate workplace inspections
- Investigate accidents and near-misses
- Ensure required training is delivered and documented
- Maintain all IIPP-required records
- Ensure corrective actions are completed on schedule
- Review and update the IIPP at least annually

---

## 2. COMPLIANCE

### A. Policy Statement

[COMPANY NAME] requires all employees to comply with safe work practices, established procedures, and all applicable health and safety regulations. This IIPP is not optional. Non-compliance has consequences.

### B. Methods for Ensuring Compliance

**Positive reinforcement:**
- Recognizing employees who consistently follow safe practices
- Including safety performance in performance evaluations
- Celebrating incident-free milestones

**Corrective action for non-compliance:**

| Violation Type | Consequence |
|----------------|-------------|
| Minor / first-time | Verbal warning; retraining |
| Repeated / moderate | Written warning; documented retraining |
| Serious / intentional | Suspension or termination |
| Creates imminent danger | Immediate removal from work area |

**No retaliation:** Employees who report safety hazards, near-misses, or violations are protected from retaliation. Disciplinary action against a safety reporter is itself a serious violation.

### C. Employee Responsibilities

All employees must:
- Follow all safe work practices and procedures
- Use required personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Report unsafe conditions to their supervisor or the Program Administrator **immediately**
- Report all injuries, illnesses, and near-misses — no matter how minor — **immediately**
- Participate in required safety training
- Never perform work they believe is unsafe without first raising the concern

### D. Supervisor Responsibilities

All supervisors must:
- Enforce safe work practices consistently
- Correct unsafe conditions or behaviors immediately — or remove employees from hazard until correction
- Investigate and report incidents within required timeframes
- Ensure their team completes required training
- Never pressure employees to work unsafely or underreport injuries

---

## 3. COMMUNICATION

### A. How We Communicate Safety Information

[COMPANY NAME] uses the following methods to keep employees informed about safety hazards and procedures:

- **New hire orientation:** Safety overview, IIPP summary, hazard review for their work area
- **Required postings:** All Cal/OSHA and OSHA required posters displayed at [LOCATION(S)]
- **Safety Data Sheets (SDS):** Maintained at [LOCATION] for all hazardous materials; accessible to all employees
- **Toolbox talks / safety meetings:** [FREQUENCY — e.g., monthly] — brief pre-shift safety discussions
- **Incident briefings:** After any significant incident, relevant information is shared with the workforce
- **Signage:** Warning signs, PPE requirements, emergency procedures posted at applicable locations
- **Email / bulletin board:** Safety alerts, updated procedures, regulatory changes

### B. Employee Reporting Channels

Employees may report safety concerns, hazards, or incidents through any of these channels:

| Channel | Contact |
|---------|---------|
| Direct supervisor | [NAME] — [PHONE] |
| IIPP Program Administrator | [NAME] — [EMAIL] — [PHONE] |
| Anonymous suggestion box | Located at [LOCATION] |
| Anonymous safety hotline | [NUMBER if applicable] |
| Cal/OSHA (external) | 1-800-963-9424 |

**Employees may report to Cal/OSHA at any time without going through internal channels first. They are fully protected from retaliation for doing so.**

### C. Non-English-Speaking Employees

Safety information is communicated in the language(s) understood by our workforce. Where 10% or more of employees speak a language other than English, safety postings, training, and critical procedures are provided in that language.

---

## 5. ACCIDENT AND EXPOSURE INVESTIGATION

### A. What Must Be Investigated

All of the following must be investigated:
- Work-related injuries (regardless of severity)
- Work-related illnesses
- Near-misses (incidents that could have caused injury or illness)
- Hazardous substance exposures
- Equipment failures or damage with safety implications

### B. Investigation Timeline

| Event | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Immediate response (secure scene, care for injured) | Immediately |
| Initial report to Program Administrator | Within 24 hours |
| Supervisor preliminary investigation | Within 24 hours |
| Full investigation completed | Within 7 days |
| Corrective action plan | Within 14 days |
| Cal/OSHA reporting (if serious injury/fatality) | **Within 8 hours — 1-800-963-9424** |

> **Cal/OSHA Serious Injury Reporting:** Any work-related fatality, inpatient hospitalization of one or more employees, loss of an eye, or amputation must be reported to Cal/OSHA within **8 hours**. Do not wait.

### C. Investigation Process

**Step 1 — Secure and Respond**
- Provide first aid or emergency care
- Call 911 if needed
- Preserve the scene — do not move equipment or materials until documented
- Photograph the scene

**Step 2 — Gather Facts**
- Interview the injured/ill employee (if possible)
- Interview witnesses
- Review equipment, materials, procedures involved
- Document physical conditions at the time

**Step 3 — Determine Root Cause**
- What directly caused the incident?
- What underlying conditions allowed it to occur?
- Was the hazard known? Was it reported?
- Were procedures being followed?
- Was training adequate?
- Was PPE available and used?

**Step 4 — Document**
- Complete IIPP-FORM-004 (Accident/Incident Report)
- Attach photos, witness statements, relevant records
- Enter in Cal/OSHA 300 Log if recordable

**Step 5 — Correct and Follow Up**
- Implement corrective actions
- Verify corrections were made
- Retrain affected employees if needed
- Review whether IIPP update is needed

### D. No Blame Culture

The goal of investigation is hazard identification and prevention — not punishment. Employees are not disciplined for being injured unless there was willful disregard of known safety requirements. The focus is always: what can we change to prevent this from happening again?

## 6. HAZARD CORRECTION

### A. Correction Priority

| Hazard Level | Definition | Response Time |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **Imminent danger** | Likely to cause serious injury or death immediately | Immediately — remove employees from area |
| **Serious** | Could cause serious injury or illness | Within 24 hours |
| **Moderate** | Could cause minor injury or illness | Within 7 days |
| **Low** | Minimal risk | Within 30 days |

### B. Interim Protection

While a hazard is being permanently corrected, interim measures must be implemented immediately. These may include:
- Removing employees from the area
- Barricading or tagging out equipment
- Providing additional PPE
- Posting warning signs
- Modifying work procedures temporarily

Interim measures are documented in IIPP-FORM-003.

### C. Tracking and Accountability

All identified hazards are tracked on IIPP-FORM-005 (Hazard Correction Log) until fully resolved. The Program Administrator reviews open items weekly. No hazard is closed until the correction is physically verified.
