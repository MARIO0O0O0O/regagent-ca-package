# FIRE PREVENTION & EXTINGUISHER USE — FACILITATOR GUIDE
## IIPP-TRAIN-004 | Live Training | 20 Minutes | Designated Employees

**Legal Authority:** 8 CCR 6151 (Fire Prevention Plan); NFPA 10
**Frequency:** Annual (designated employees); upon assignment | **Version:** 1.0 | February 2026

**Note:** Not all employees need hands-on extinguisher training. Cal/OSHA requires training only for employees who will be expected to use extinguishers. Employees not designated to fight fires should evacuate — this training covers both groups.

## SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:03 — THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION

[READ ALOUD]
"Before we discuss how to use a fire extinguisher, we need to cover when to use one — because the answer is not always. The decision tree is this:

Evacuate immediately if: the fire is larger than a wastebasket; there is smoke filling the space; you don't know what is burning; you don't have a clear exit path behind you; you have any doubt.

Consider using an extinguisher only if: the fire is small and contained; it hasn't spread; you have already called 911; you have a clear exit behind you; and you are trained. If any of those conditions is not met — evacuate. A fire extinguisher is not worth your life."

### 0:03-0:08 — FIRE CLASSES AND EXTINGUISHER TYPES

[READ ALOUD]
"Using the wrong extinguisher on certain fires can make things dramatically worse. You need to know the fire classes.

Class A — ordinary combustibles. Paper, wood, cloth, plastics. Most common type.
Class B — flammable liquids and gases. Gasoline, oil, paint, solvents.
Class C — electrical equipment. Energized wiring, motors, electrical panels.
Class D — combustible metals. Rare in most workplaces. Magnesium, titanium.
Class K — cooking oils and fats. Kitchen fire.

Our extinguishers: [DESCRIBE TYPE AND LOCATION — most offices use ABC dry chemical or CO2]
ABC dry chemical — handles Class A, B, and C. Most common general purpose extinguisher.
CO2 — Class B and C only. Good for electrical fires. Leaves no residue — good for server rooms.
Class K — kitchen only.

[SHOW the extinguishers in your facility. Point out the label which shows what class it covers.]"

### 0:08-0:15 — PASS TECHNIQUE

[READ ALOUD]
"If you have confirmed it is appropriate to use an extinguisher, use the PASS technique:

P — Pull the pin. It breaks a tamper seal. The pin prevents accidental discharge.
A — Aim at the base of the fire. Not the flames — the base where the fuel is. This is the most common mistake.
S — Squeeze the handle. Releases the extinguishing agent.
S — Sweep from side to side. Keep the nozzle aimed at the base of the fire and move across it in a sweeping motion.

Back away from the fire as it diminishes — don't turn your back.
Maintain your exit behind you at all times.
If the extinguisher empties and the fire isn't out — get out immediately.

Even if you successfully extinguish a fire, call 911. Hidden embers can reignite."

[FACILITATOR NOTE: If you conduct live extinguisher training at your facility, this is where you move to the hands-on component. If not, use video or photos to illustrate PASS.]

### 0:15-0:18 — FIRE PREVENTION

[READ ALOUD]
"The best fire response is one you never have to make. Our fire prevention practices:

Keep exits, emergency equipment, and electrical panels clear — minimum 3 feet clearance around panels at all times.

No unauthorized extension cords or power strips. Daisy-chaining power strips is a leading cause of office fires.

Report any electrical concerns immediately — burning smell, sparks, flickering lights, unusually warm outlets.

Store flammable materials [in designated locations — describe your workplace setup]. Never store flammables near heat sources.

Know the locations of all fire extinguishers: [LIST LOCATIONS]. Know the locations of all pull stations: [LIST]."

### 0:18-0:20 — Q&A AND SIGN-IN
