## SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:05 — WELCOME

[READ ALOUD]
"Today we're covering ergonomics — one of the most underestimated safety topics in most workplaces. Musculoskeletal disorders — things like carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis, and back injuries — are among the most common workplace injuries in California. They develop slowly over months or years, which is why people often don't connect them to work until the damage is done.

The goal today is to help you recognize the risk factors in your own work, make adjustments that reduce your exposure, and most importantly — report symptoms early, before they become something serious."

### 0:05-0:15 — ERGONOMIC HAZARDS

[READ ALOUD]
"Cal/OSHA's Repetitive Motion Injuries standard applies when two or more employees doing the same or similar work develop musculoskeletal injuries. But we don't wait for that threshold — we address ergonomic hazards proactively.

The five primary ergonomic risk factors are:

Repetition — doing the same motion over and over, thousands of times a day. Typing. Assembly. Scanning items. The motion itself isn't harmful — the accumulation is.

Force — exerting significant effort, especially with hands or back. Heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, gripping tools tightly.

Awkward posture — working with your body in a position it was not designed to sustain. Reaching overhead, bending forward for extended periods, twisting your back, flexing your wrist while typing.

Static posture — staying in one position for too long. Standing in one place, sitting in a fixed position at a desk, holding a tool in a fixed grip.

Contact stress — pressing a body part against a hard or sharp edge. Leaning your wrists on the desk edge, resting your forearms on the corner of a workstation.

The more of these factors present at once, the higher the risk. Repetitive motion combined with force and awkward posture is the most dangerous combination."

DISCUSSION: "Looking at your own work — which of these factors applies to what you do most of the time?"

### 0:15-0:22 — WORKSTATION AND BODY MECHANICS

[READ ALOUD]
"For office and computer work:

Your screen should be at eye level — not up, not down. If you're looking down at your screen all day, your neck is carrying significant forward head weight that adds up to injury over years.

Your elbows should be at 90 degrees when typing. Wrists should be flat — not bent up or down. If you're bending your wrist to type, you're building up carpal tunnel risk.

Feet flat on the floor. Hips and knees at approximately 90 degrees. Lower back supported by your chair — don't sit on the edge and hunch.

Take a break from fixed postures every 30-60 minutes. Stand up, stretch, walk briefly. Set a reminder if you need to.

For lifting and manual tasks:

Lift with your legs, not your back. Keep the load close to your body. Never twist your back while lifting — pivot your whole body with your feet. For anything over [COMPANY THRESHOLD — typically 50 lbs], use mechanical assistance or ask for help.

### 0:22-0:28 — EARLY SYMPTOM REPORTING

[READ ALOUD]
"This is the most important part of today's training: report symptoms early.

The symptoms of a developing musculoskeletal injury are: aching, tingling, numbness, burning sensation, stiffness, or loss of grip strength in your hands, wrists, arms, shoulders, neck, or back. These symptoms often appear first outside of work — at night, on weekends. That doesn't mean they're not work-related.

When you notice these symptoms, report them to your supervisor immediately. Do not wait until you can barely use your hand. We have access to ergonomic assessment, equipment modifications, and early intervention that can stop an injury from developing — but only if we know about it.

Under California law, if we receive a report of a musculoskeletal injury and identify two or more employees with similar symptoms doing similar work, we are required to implement an ergonomics correction program. The sooner we know, the sooner we can fix it for everyone."
