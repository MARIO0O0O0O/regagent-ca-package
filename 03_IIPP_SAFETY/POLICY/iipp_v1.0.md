## 5. HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### A. Assessment Methods
- **Physical inspection:** Walk-through of all work areas; equipment, tools, materials, physical conditions
- **Record review:** OSHA 300 logs, workers comp claims, prior incidents, prior Cal/OSHA findings
- **Employee input:** Interviews, safety meetings, anonymous suggestions, post-incident debriefs
- **Regulatory review:** Applicable Cal/OSHA Title 8 and OSHA standards for our industry

### B. Current Hazard Inventory (Customize per your workplace)

| Hazard | Location | Risk Level | Current Controls | Additional Controls Needed |
|--------|----------|------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Slip/trip hazards | | H / M / L | | |
| Ergonomic — repetitive motion | | H / M / L | | |
| Hazardous chemicals | | H / M / L | | |
| Electrical hazards | | H / M / L | | |
| Heavy lifting | | H / M / L | | |

### C. Reassessment Schedule
- Annually in [MONTH]
- When new equipment, materials, or processes are introduced
- After any workplace injury, illness, or near-miss
- Upon employee request or safety complaint

---

## 6. ACCIDENT AND EXPOSURE INVESTIGATION

### A. What Must Be Investigated
All work-related injuries or illnesses (any severity), near-misses, employee hazard complaints, and potential hazardous substance exposures.

### B. Investigation Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Immediate | Within hours | First aid; secure scene; notify Program Administrator |
| Initial | Within 24 hours | Begin investigation; interview witnesses; document scene |
| Investigation | Within 7 days | Complete written report; identify root cause; corrective actions |
| Correction | Within 30 days | Implement corrections; verify effectiveness; update IIPP if needed |

### C. Root Cause Analysis
For every incident identify whether the cause was an unsafe condition (physical hazard), unsafe behavior (rule violation), or system failure (training gap, inadequate procedure, management oversight).
Important: "Employee error" is almost never a complete root cause. Behind most errors is a system factor — inadequate training, unclear procedures, or production pressure. Investigations must go deep enough to find it.

### D. Cal/OSHA Reporting Requirements

| Situation | Action | Deadline |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Work-related fatality | Call Cal/OSHA | Within 8 hours |
| In-patient hospitalization (1+ employees) | Call Cal/OSHA | Within 8 hours |
| Amputation or loss of eye | Call Cal/OSHA | Within 8 hours |
| OSHA 300 recordable injury | Log on OSHA 300 | Within 7 calendar days |

**Cal/OSHA 24-Hour Reporting:** 1-800-963-9424

---

## 7. HAZARD CORRECTION

### A. Correction Priority

| Risk Level | Timeline | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Imminent danger | Immediately or remove employees | Exposed live electrical, structural failure |
| High | Within 24-72 hours | Serious trip hazard, blocked emergency exit |
| Medium | Within 1-2 weeks | Inadequate lighting, ergonomic risk |
| Low | Within 30 days | Minor housekeeping, worn signage |

### B. Interim Controls
When a hazard cannot be corrected immediately: barricade the area, post warnings, assign monitoring, modify procedures, require additional PPE, or reduce employee exposure time.

### C. Tracking
All identified hazards and corrective actions are tracked in the Hazard Log (IIPP-FORM-005). Program Administrator reviews monthly and reports status to management.

---

## 8. TRAINING AND INSTRUCTION

### A. When Training Is Required
- Before job assignment — before any work task with associated hazards
- When new hazards are introduced — before new equipment, chemicals, or processes are used
- When procedures change — before implementing changes affecting safety
- After incidents — refresher training following injury, near-miss, or hazard identification
- Annual refresher — required topics reviewed each year

### B. Training Standards
Training must be: in a language the employee understands; by a qualified trainer; interactive with Q&A opportunity; documented; and verified (employee demonstrates understanding, not just attendance).

### C. Training Delivery
All required safety training is delivered live and interactive — in-person or webinar. No self-paced or passive training satisfies these requirements.
