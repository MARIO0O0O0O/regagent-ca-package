## MODULE 1 — EAP OVERVIEW + ROLES
*[5 minutes]*

**[OPEN — Say:]**

"This is a short but critical training. Emergencies are rare — but when they happen, you don't have time to figure out what to do. We're going to make sure you already know."

**Our Emergency Action Plan is posted at: [LOCATION(S)]**

**Key roles:**

| Role | Name | Phone |

| Backup Coordinator | [NAME] | [PHONE] |
| Floor Warden — [AREA] | [NAME] | [PHONE] |

## MODULE 2 — EVACUATION PROCEDURES
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[Walk through or display evacuation map. For in-person sessions, physically walk the route.]*

**Evacuation Steps:**

1. **Hear the alarm or evacuation order** — leave immediately. No debate, no finishing tasks.
2. **Take your essentials only** — phone if in reach. Nothing else slows you down.
3. **Use your designated exit:**
   - Primary exit: [DIRECTION / DOOR]
   - Secondary exit: [DIRECTION / DOOR]
   - Do NOT use elevators.
4. **Help others as you go** — alert people nearby, assist those with mobility limitations if you can do so safely. Designated assistants for mobility-impaired employees: [NAME(S)]
5. **Proceed to assembly point: [LOCATION / ADDRESS]**
6. **Report to your supervisor or floor warden** — they will account for all employees.
7. **Do not return to the building until the all-clear is given by [FIRE DEPT / COORDINATOR].**

**"If you cannot evacuate — for any reason — call 911 and tell them your location. Shelter in place: close doors and windows, move away from the door, signal for help from the window if possible."**

## MODULE 3 — FIRE AND MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
*[10 minutes]*

---

**FIRE:**

"If you discover or suspect a fire:"

4. Evacuate as described above — do not delay to investigate or fight the fire
5. If it's a small, contained fire and you're trained: use the fire extinguisher using the **PASS** technique:
   - **P**ull the pin
   - **A**im at the base of the fire
   - **S**queeze the handle
   - **S**weep side to side
6. **If the fire is growing, spreading, or producing smoke — get out. Do not fight it.**

## MODULE 4 — ACTIVE THREAT
*[3 minutes]*

---

**[Say:]**

"In the very unlikely event of an active threat — someone with a weapon at or near our facility:"

**Run:** Get out if you can do so safely. Leave everything. Call 911 when you're safe.

**Hide:** If you can't run — go to a room, lock/barricade the door, turn off lights, silence your phone, stay away from windows and doors. Do not open the door for anyone until police arrive.

**Fight:** Only as a last resort, if your life is in immediate danger and you have no other option. Use whatever is available. Act with commitment.

"Our communication method in an active threat: [OVERHEAD / TEXT ALERT / MANAGER NOTIFICATION]"

"Go to the nearest safe exit if you can — do not go toward the threat to investigate."
