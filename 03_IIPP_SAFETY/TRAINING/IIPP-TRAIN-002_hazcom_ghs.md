# HAZARD COMMUNICATION (HAZCOM / GHS) — FACILITATOR GUIDE
## IIPP-TRAIN-002 | Live Training | 45 Minutes | All Employees

**Legal Authority:** 8 CCR 5194 (Cal/OSHA HazCom Standard, aligned with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200 / UN GHS)
**Frequency:** Upon hire; when new hazardous chemicals are introduced | **Version:** 1.0 | February 2026

---

## WHY THIS TRAINING IS REQUIRED

The California Hazard Communication Standard gives employees the "right to know" about hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Employers must: maintain a written HazCom program; keep Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for all hazardous chemicals; label all containers; and train employees to understand labels and SDS before they work with or near any hazardous chemical.

---

## PRE-TRAINING CHECKLIST
- [ ] Identify all hazardous chemicals present in the workplace before training
- [ ] Confirm SDS is available for every chemical — located at [LOCATION]
- [ ] Bring sample chemical containers with GHS labels to training (or photos for webinar)
- [ ] Sign-in roster (IIPP-FORM-006)

## SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:05 — WELCOME AND LEGAL CONTEXT

[READ ALOUD]
"Today's training is on Hazard Communication — HazCom — which California law requires every employer to provide. The simple version: if there are hazardous chemicals in this workplace, you have a right to know what they are, what the hazards are, and how to protect yourself.

We use the Globally Harmonized System — GHS — for chemical labeling and Safety Data Sheets. This is the international standard. Once you know how to read a GHS label and an SDS, you can understand a chemical's hazards anywhere in the world."

### 0:05-0:15 — GHS LABELS

[SHOW sample label / photo — or hold up a real container]

[READ ALOUD]
"Every container of hazardous chemicals in this workplace must have a GHS label with six required elements. Let me walk through each one.

One — Product Identifier. The chemical's name. It must match the name on the SDS.

Two — Signal Word. Either DANGER (more severe hazard) or WARNING (less severe hazard). That one word tells you immediately how seriously to take the rest of the label.

Three — Hazard Statements. These describe the nature of the hazard — 'Flammable liquid and vapor,' 'Causes serious eye damage,' 'May be fatal if swallowed.' Read these carefully. They are not general warnings — they are specific to this chemical.

Four — Pictograms. These are the GHS symbols in a red diamond. Each one means something specific. A flame means flammable. A skull and crossbones means acute toxicity — can cause death or serious injury quickly. An exclamation mark means a less severe hazard. A person with damage to their chest means respiratory or organ hazard. You should know all nine GHS pictograms — they're on your handout.

Five — Precautionary Statements. What to do to prevent harm — 'Keep away from heat,' 'Wear protective gloves,' 'Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.'

Six — Manufacturer Information. Name, address, and phone of the chemical manufacturer."

ACTIVITY: [Hold up a container or show a photo of a label]
"Let's look at this label together. What's the signal word? What hazards does it describe? What precautions does it require?"
[Walk through it together — 3-4 minutes.]

### 0:15-0:25 — SAFETY DATA SHEETS

[READ ALOUD]
"A Safety Data Sheet — SDS — is a 16-section document that gives you detailed information about a hazardous chemical. Every chemical we use has one. They are located at [LOCATION] and you have the right to access them at any time — during work hours, without asking permission.

You don't need to memorize all 16 sections. You need to know the five sections you'll use most:

Section 1 — Identification. Product name, manufacturer, emergency phone number. If something goes wrong at 2am, this is how you reach the manufacturer.

Section 2 — Hazard Identification. Complete list of hazards. Signal word. GHS pictograms. All the hazard and precautionary statements from the label, plus more detail.

Section 4 — First Aid Measures. What to do if you inhale it, swallow it, get it on your skin, get it in your eyes. This section is written for first responders — memorize where it is.

Section 7 — Handling and Storage. How to use it safely, what to keep it away from, storage temperature requirements.

Section 8 — Exposure Controls and PPE. What personal protective equipment is required — gloves, goggles, respirator. What ventilation is needed. This tells you exactly what to wear before you open the container."

DISCUSSION: "Where are our SDS binders or files located? Has anyone ever had to look something up in an SDS?" [Show the location. Make this real.]

### 0:25-0:35 — HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN OUR WORKPLACE

[READ ALOUD]
"We maintain a complete chemical inventory for our workplace. Here are the chemicals you may encounter in your role: [LIST CHEMICALS SPECIFIC TO YOUR WORKPLACE]

For each one: [Walk through the most significant chemicals — name, primary hazard, required PPE, location of SDS]

[FACILITATOR NOTE: Customize this section completely for your workplace. If you use no hazardous chemicals, this section is brief — confirm that and discuss what 'consumer use quantities' of common products means and why they still require SDS access.]"

---

### 0:35-0:43 — EXPOSURE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

[READ ALOUD]
"If you are exposed to a hazardous chemical — whether by inhalation, skin contact, eye contact, or ingestion — the first step is always to go to the SDS Section 4. It tells you exactly what to do for that specific chemical.

General guidance: For skin or eye contact, flush with water for at least 15-20 minutes. Our eyewash station is at [LOCATION]. For inhalation, move to fresh air immediately. For ingestion, do not induce vomiting unless the SDS specifically says to — call Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222 or 911.

After any exposure — report it to your supervisor immediately. Even if you feel fine. Symptoms of some chemical exposures are delayed. Your supervisor will complete an incident report and we may need medical evaluation.

If there's a spill: refer to SDS Section 6 — Accidental Release Measures. It will tell you exactly how to contain and clean up that specific chemical safely. If the spill is large or the chemical is highly hazardous, evacuate the area and call 911."

### 0:43-0:45 — Q&A AND SIGN-IN

[READ ALOUD]
"Key takeaways: Know how to read a GHS label — six elements. Know the five SDS sections you'll use most. Know where our SDS are kept. And always report any chemical exposure immediately.

Questions? Please sign the roster before you leave."
