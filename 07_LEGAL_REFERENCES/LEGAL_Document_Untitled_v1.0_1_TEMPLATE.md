**Project Purpose:** Audit personnel records for compliance, identify systemic gaps, and deliver actionable remediation roadmap.

## Project Scope: What I Will Audit

### IN SCOPE: Personnel Records Review

✅ **Employee Identification & Classification**

- Verify exempt vs. non-exempt status against salary thresholds ([AMOUNT] min for 2025)
- Apply ABC test for any independent contractors (_Dynamex; AB 5_)
- Validate professional exemptions for PE, PG, AICP licensed staff

✅ **Personnel Action Forms (PAFs) & Core Documents**

- Employee identification data, classification, wage rates, compensation structure
- Benefit package details and eligibility
- Hire dates, status changes, terminations

✅ **Mandatory Document Presence (47-Point Checklist)**

- I-9 forms (must be stored separately) | W-4/DE-4 | Handbook acknowledgments
- Wage Theft Prevention Act notices (_Lab. Code § 2810.5_) | Offer letters
- Harassment prevention training certificates (biennial requirement)
- Professional licenses and continuing education (_SB 513 requirement_)

✅ **File Organization & Segregation**

- Medical records separation (_FEHA, ADA_) | Confidential investigation files
- I-9 storage compliance (_8 USC § 1324a_) | Retention schedule adherence

✅ **Policy Existence & Adequacy Assessment**

- Legally required policies: Anti-harassment, lactation accommodation, paid sick leave, workplace violence prevention (_SB 553_)
- Best practice policies: Remote work, expense reimbursement, progressive discipline
- Environmental consulting-specific: Professional licensing maintenance, CEQA record retention, field expense protocols

✅ **Environmental Consulting Specifics**

- Multi-jurisdiction wage tracking (Pasadena [AMOUNT] vs. CA [AMOUNT])
- Field employee expense reimbursement compliance (_Lab. Code § 2802_)
- CEQA administrative record retention policies
- Professional license renewal tracking (PE, PG, AICP)

### OUT OF SCOPE: Accounting/Payroll Verification

❌ Paycheck calculation accuracy (Accounting's responsibility)  
❌ Payroll tax withholding verification  
❌ 401(k) financial audit (will check Form 5500 filing status only)  
❌ Legal representation or attorney-client privileged advice  
❌ Software implementation (recommendations only)

**Boundary Statement:** HR provides facts (classification, wage rates, benefits) via PAFs. Accounting verifies those facts translate to correct paychecks. This audit verifies HR's records exist, are complete, and are properly maintained.

## Risk Management & Escalation

### Immediate Escalation Triggers:

- **Missing I-9s:** [AMOUNT]-[AMOUNT] penalty per form (_8 USC § 1324a_)
- **Systemic wage statement errors:** PAGA exposure = [AMOUNT]-[AMOUNT]/employee/pay period
- **Evidence of misclassification:** Back wages + penalties + interest
- **Active PAGA demand or government audit:** Recommend legal counsel immediately

### PAGA "Right to Cure" Opportunity:

2024 reforms allow 33-day cure period for certain violations, reducing penalties up to 100% if fixed promptly (_Lab. Code § 2699.3_)

### Data Security Commitments:

- Encrypted laptop/storage (BitLocker/FileVault)
- No SSNs or bank info on personal devices
- Physical documents reviewed on-site only
- All work product destroyed/returned after 90 days (unless you request retention)
