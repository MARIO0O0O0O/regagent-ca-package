4. CROSS-REFERENCE: HOW OTHER LAWS IMPACT TERMINATION
4.1 WAGE & HOUR → TERMINATION
Legal Principle: Waiting Time Penalties (Labor Code § 203). Compliance Impact:
* [ ] Calculation: If you are late paying the final check, you owe 1 day of average wages for every day late (up to 30 days).
   * Example: Employee earns $200/day. You pay 10 days late. You owe $200 x 10 = $2,000 penalty. Cross-Reference: → [Wage & Hour Checklist]
4.2 PERSONNEL RECORDS → TERMINATION
Legal Principle: Retention clocks start ticking. Compliance Impact:
* [ ] File Movement: Move file to "Terminated" storage.
* [ ] Retention:
   * [ ] I-9: Keep for 1 year post-term (or 3 years post-hire).
   * [ ] Personnel File: Keep for 4 years.
   * [ ] Safety Training (SB 513): Keep for 3 years. Cross-Reference: → [Personnel Records Checklist]
4.3 AB 692 (STAY-OR-PAY) → TERMINATION
Legal Principle: Illegal deductions. Compliance Impact:
* [ ] Deductions: You CANNOT deduct "training costs" or "recruiting fees" from the final check.
* [ ] Debt: Even if they owe you money (loan), you generally cannot take it from the final check without a specific written agreement signed at the time of the loan. Cross-Reference: → [AB 692 Stay-or-Pay Checklist]
4.4 HARASSMENT PREVENTION → TERMINATION
Legal Principle: Retaliation defense. Compliance Impact:
* [ ] Documentation: If firing for cause (e.g., poor performance), ensure the personnel file (Container 1) has the history of warnings. Firing a "clean record" employee looks like discrimination. Cross-Reference: → [Harassment Prevention Checklist]
5. Penalties
* Waiting Time Penalties: Up to 30 days of wages.
* Paperwork Violations: Minor fines, but failure to give EDD notice can hinder their unemployment claim and anger the EDD.
