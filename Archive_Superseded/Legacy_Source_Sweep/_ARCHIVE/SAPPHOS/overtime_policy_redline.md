## 1. EXEMPT STATUS AND NON-EXEMPT STATUS

### 1.1 Exempt Employees

Employees who are exempt from overtime provisions, as defined by the **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 207, and California Labor Code § 515**, are considered to be exempt. These executive and professional employees do not receive overtime pay for overtime work.

**[COMPLIANCE NOTE: Added specific statutory citations - 29 U.S.C. § 207 and California Labor Code § 515]**

~~**2.2.8 Flextime for Exempt Employees**~~

~~Exempt employees may be required to work an extended workweek without additional compensation as stipulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). However, in consideration of unforeseen work assignment, the need to work on non-regularly scheduled workdays (i.e. weekends) or company holiday(s), or the need for specific time off after vacation has been exhausted, at the sole discretion of management, flextime may be granted to account for an exempt employee's extended workweek, including non-regularly scheduled or holiday work.~~

~~Generally, an exempt employee may be eligible for flextime subject to specified circumstances in accordance with the corresponding procedures, and subject to approval by the assigned supervisor, manager, or director, and Human Resources:~~

~~- The request for flextime needs to be communicated and approved before working an extended workweek or holiday work.~~
~~- Working an extended workweek or holiday work must be completed prior to using the earned equivalent flextime.~~
~~- Flextime is understood as time off for work completed in anticipation and thus is granted at a 1:1 ratio in correspondence with the excess time worked during an extended workweek, non-regularly scheduled or holiday hours worked.~~
~~- Only billable hours and fieldwork count toward earned flextime. Training, marketing, or other hours are not a basis for accruing flextime.~~
~~- Flextime is paid at the same level of compensation specified in the employee's offer of employment.~~
~~- The minimum allowable consideration for accrual of flextime is four hours.~~
~~- Flextime may not be entered in an employee's timesheet as a distinctive category but must rather be reflected in the documentation of the extended workweek.~~
~~- When an employee works on a scheduled holiday, they will enter the hours worked on the holiday, and enter the holiday code on the agreed upon date for the rescheduled holiday.~~
~~- All flextime earned in any given workweek must be used within the following two workweeks unless unviable or alternatively decided by management. At this time the exempt employee may opt in to get paid for their overtime hours instead of taking flex time, but cannot do both.~~

~~Please note that flextime is to be avoided unless necessary. Employees should strive to maintain consistent work schedules and exhaust all other means of paid time off before requesting flextime. Supervisors should plan in advance and coordinate efforts with employees so as to minimize the need for flextime, if possible.~~

**[CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ISSUE - SECTION DELETED: This entire flextime provision violates the FLSA salary basis test (29 C.F.R. § 541.602) and California law. Private employers are prohibited from providing compensatory time or "hour-for-hour" time off programs for exempt employees. See 29 U.S.C. § 207(o) (comp time limited to public agencies only). The Employers Council and federal regulations clearly state that programs providing "an hour for an hour" violate the salary basis requirement for exempt employees. Exempt employees must be paid their full predetermined salary for any week in which they perform work, with very limited exceptions. This policy would jeopardize employees' exempt status and expose the company to significant overtime liability.]**

**NEW SECTION 1.2: Salary Requirements for Exempt Employees**

**To maintain exempt status under California Labor Code § 515(a) and federal law, exempt employees must:**

1. **Receive a predetermined monthly salary of no less than two times the California minimum wage for full-time employment (40 hours/week);**
2. **For 2025: Minimum salary of $68,640 annually ($5,720 monthly, $1,320 weekly) based on California minimum wage of $16.50/hour (effective January 1, 2025);**
3. **Note: Pasadena Minimum Wage Ordinance requires $18.04/hour (effective July 1, 2025), which results in a higher exempt salary threshold of $75,043.20 annually for employees working in Pasadena;**
4. **Be paid on a "salary basis" meaning the employee receives a predetermined amount constituting all or part of compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed (29 C.F.R. § 541.602(a));**
5. **Spend more than 50% of work time performing exempt duties (executive, administrative, or professional duties as defined by applicable wage orders).**

**[COMPLIANCE NOTE: Added mandatory salary requirements per California Labor Code § 515 and updated for 2025 minimum wage increases. Pasadena Municipal Code § 4.120 requires higher minimum wage which affects exempt salary calculations.]**

## 2. NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEES

Employees who are not exempt from overtime provisions as defined by the **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., and California Labor Code § 510** are considered to be nonexempt. Nonexempt employees receive overtime pay for overtime work.

**[COMPLIANCE NOTE: Added specific statutory citations]**

---

## 3. AUTHORIZED OVERTIME FOR NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEES

At times, Sapphos Environmental, Inc. will have a need for nonexempt employees to work hours in excess of a regularly scheduled workweek. All overtime worked by nonexempt employees ~~can only be authorized~~ **should be authorized** by a member of the management or executive staff, and the authorization **should be obtained** in advance of the time being worked **whenever possible**.

**[COMPLIANCE CHANGE: California law requires payment for all overtime worked, whether authorized or not. Changed "can only" to "should be" to reflect legal requirement while maintaining management preference. See Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court, 53 Cal.4th 1004 (2012)]**

~~All nonexempt employees are expected to be available to work overtime as needed on 20 percent of scheduled workdays. It is understood that nonexempt employees may have other obligations that prevent them from being available to work overtime. On such occasions, the nonexempt employee must inform the person making the request at the time the request is being made of unavailability to work. A continued pattern of a nonexempt employee being unavailable to work overtime within the stated 20 percent of scheduled workdays may result in disciplinary action.~~ **Nonexempt employees may be asked to work overtime as business needs require. While the company appreciates employees' flexibility and availability, we recognize that employees have personal obligations. Employees should communicate any scheduling conflicts as early as possible. Regular and reliable attendance, including reasonable availability for overtime when business needs arise, is an essential function of employment.**

**[COMPLIANCE CHANGE: Removed specific 20% requirement and softened language to avoid potential retaliation claims and ensure compliance with California Labor Code § 1198.5 (prohibiting discrimination for refusing to work in unsafe conditions) and general anti-retaliation protections.]**

A continued pattern of a nonexempt employee performing unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action **; however, the company will pay all overtime worked regardless of authorization status, in compliance with California Labor Code § 510 and federal law**.

**[COMPLIANCE ADDITION: Clarified legal obligation to pay unauthorized overtime per California law]**

## 4. OVERTIME COMPENSATION FOR NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEES

Employees may be required to work overtime as necessary. Only actual hours worked in a given workday or workweek can apply in calculating overtime. All overtime work ~~must be~~ **should be** approved in advance by the supervising manager **whenever possible**. Sapphos Environmental, Inc. provides compensation for overtime in accordance with state and federal laws as follows:

**Per California Labor Code § 510:**

- **1.5 times your regular hourly rate for:**
  - **Hours worked beyond 8 but not exceeding 12 hours on a single workday;**

- **2 times your regular hourly rate for:**
  - **Hours worked beyond 12 hours on a single workday;**
  - **Hours worked beyond 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek.**

**[CRITICAL COMPLIANCE CORRECTION: Previous policy incorrectly stated double-time begins after 10 hours. California Labor Code § 510 requires double-time after 12 hours in a workday, not 10. Added seventh consecutive day provisions which were missing from original policy.]**

### 4.1 Compensation for Meetings, Training, and Lectures

Sapphos Environmental, Inc. will pay nonexempt employees for attendance at meetings, lectures, and training programs under the following conditions **per 29 C.F.R. § 785.27-32**:

- The employee attends the event**;**
- Attendance has been **required or** approved, in advance, by the employee's manager**;**
- The meeting, course, or lecture is directly related to the employee's job**.** 

**[COMPLIANCE CHANGE: Clarified that required training must be paid regardless of pre-approval, per federal regulations]**

Any work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40 hours in a week will be paid at the appropriate overtime rate, at the hourly rate in effect at the time the overtime **work** ~~worked~~ is being performed.

### 4.2 Exclusions from Overtime Calculations

Vacation, sick **leave**, holiday pay, and jury **duty** service are not counted as hours worked for overtime calculations **per 29 C.F.R. § 778.218**.

- **Meal and rest break times;**
- **Total hours worked each workweek;**
- **Rate(s) of pay and total wages paid each pay period.**

**[COMPLIANCE ADDITION: Added mandatory recordkeeping requirements per California law]**

**All nonexempt employees will be paid no less than the applicable minimum wage:**

- **California State Minimum Wage: $16.50/hour (effective January 1, 2025)**
