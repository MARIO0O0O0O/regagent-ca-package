# High-Level KPI Workflow

1. Employees submit weekly timesheets (billable & non-billable hours)
2. HR collects leave data, flags protected and company leaves
3. Adjusted Chargeability calculated:
   Adjusted Chargeability (%) = Chargeable Hours ÷ (Total Available Hours – Protected Leave Hours) × 100
4. KPI tables generated for executive review
5. Broader KPIs calculated (Revenue per employee, Project margin, Realization rate, Client satisfaction)
6. Quarterly and annual summaries presented to leadership
7. Equity audits performed to ensure fair treatment across gender, role, and leave type
