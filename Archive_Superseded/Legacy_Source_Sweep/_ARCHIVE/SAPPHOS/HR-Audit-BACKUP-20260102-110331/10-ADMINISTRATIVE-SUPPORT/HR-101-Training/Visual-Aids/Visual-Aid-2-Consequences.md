## Why Breaches Happen

### Common Mistakes:
1. **Gossip** - "Did you hear about..."
2. **Curiosity** - Looking up friend's/coworker's file
3. **Carelessness** - Leaving documents on desk
4. **Public Discussion** - Talking in cafeteria/elevator
5. **Oversharing** - Telling family about work

### How to Avoid:
- ✅ Follow three-tier system
