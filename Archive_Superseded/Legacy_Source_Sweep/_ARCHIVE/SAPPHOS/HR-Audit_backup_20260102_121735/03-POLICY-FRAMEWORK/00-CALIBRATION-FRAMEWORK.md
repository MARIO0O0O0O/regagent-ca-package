# 🎚️ Policy Calibration Framework

## Purpose

Balance policy requirements between:
- ✅ Legal compliance (non-negotiable floor)
- 🎯 Company culture (flexibility where appropriate)
- ⚖️ Risk mitigation (proportional to exposure)
- 👥 Employee experience (reasonable enforcement)

---

## Rigidity Spectrum (1-10 Scale)

### Score Definitions

**10 - Maximum Rigidity (Zero Tolerance)**
- No discretion allowed
- Automatic consequences
- Strict enforcement required
- *Use for:* Harassment, discrimination, safety violations

**7-9 - High Structure**
- Limited discretion
- Clear consequences with minor flexibility
- Documented exceptions only
- *Use for:* Attendance, leave policies, performance standards

**4-6 - Moderate Balance**
- Manager discretion within guidelines
- Graduated consequences
- Context-specific application
- *Use for:* Dress code, remote work, scheduling

**1-3 - High Flexibility**
- Significant discretion
- Guideline-based
- Individual circumstances considered
- *Use for:* Work hours (exempt), PTO usage, professional development

## Calibration Methodology

### Step 1: Legal Floor Analysis
\\\
For each policy area:
1. Identify legal requirements (federal + CA)
2. Research case law (litigation risk)
3. Document non-discretionary elements
4. Mark as "Legal Floor" (cannot go below)
\\\

### Step 2: Industry Benchmark
\\\
Research 5-10 comparable organizations:
- Similar size (20-100 employees)
- Similar industry
- California-based
- Document their approach
- Identify median rigidity level
\\\

### Step 3: Culture Fit Assessment
\\\
Evaluate company culture on:
1. Autonomy vs. structure (1-10)
2. Trust vs. verification (1-10)
3. Flexibility vs. consistency (1-10)
4. Innovation vs. process (1-10)

Calculate average = Culture Score
\\\

### Step 4: Risk Calibration
\\\
Assess risk for each policy:
- Litigation history (our company + industry)
- Regulatory scrutiny (DLSE, EEOC, Cal-OSHA)
- Financial exposure
- Reputational risk

High risk = increase rigidity +2 points
Medium risk = maintain benchmark
Low risk = decrease rigidity -1 point
\\\

### Step 5: Final Calibration
\\\
Final Score = MAX(Legal Floor, 
                  (Industry Benchmark + Culture Adjustment + Risk Adjustment) / 3)

Round to nearest integer (1-10)
\\\

## Example: Harassment Prevention Policy

### Analysis

**Legal Floor:** 9/10 (Gov. Code § 12950.1 - very strict)
**Industry Benchmark:** 9/10 (universally high)
**Culture Score:** 7/10 (moderately flexible culture)
**Risk Assessment:** 10/10 (high litigation risk)

**Calculation:**
- Legal Floor = 9
- (9 + 7 + 10) / 3 = 8.67
- MAX(9, 8.67) = **9/10**

**Recommendation:** 9/10 rigidity - near zero tolerance with minimal discretion only for truly ambiguous situations

## Example: Remote Work Policy

### Analysis

**Legal Floor:** 1/10 (no legal requirement)
**Industry Benchmark:** 5/10 (mixed approaches)
**Culture Score:** 8/10 (flexible, trust-based)
**Risk Assessment:** 2/10 (low risk)

**Calculation:**
- Legal Floor = 1
- (5 + 8 + 2) / 3 = 5
- MAX(1, 5) = **5/10**

**Recommendation:** 5/10 rigidity - manager discretion within guidelines, flexible based on role and performance

## Documentation Template

For each policy:

### [Policy Name]

**Legal Requirements:**
- [ ] Federal: [statute/regulation]
- [ ] California: [statute/regulation]
- [ ] Case Law: [relevant cases]

**Rigidity Analysis:**
- Legal Floor: X/10
- Industry Benchmark: X/10
- Culture Fit: X/10
- Risk Level: X/10
- **Final Calibration: X/10**

**Policy Language:**
- **Mandatory Elements:** [non-discretionary]
- **Discretionary Elements:** [where flexibility allowed]
- **Enforcement:** [consequences + escalation]

**Justification:**
[Why this rigidity level is appropriate]

## Periodic Recalibration

Review annually or when:
- ✅ Legislation changes
- ✅ New case law emerges
- ✅ Company culture shifts
- ✅ Incident occurs
