    subject: "The $80K PAGA lawsuit that could have been prevented",
    previewText: "Real story from an LA restaurant. Don't let this happen to you.",
    body: `
Hi [First Name],

Let me tell you about Maria (name changed for privacy).

She owns a popular Mexican restaurant in Downtown LA. 25 employees, great food, loyal customers. Business was good.

Then she got the letter: a PAGA lawsuit for $80,000.

THE VIOLATION:

Her pay stubs were missing one line: "sick leave available." That's it. One missing line, replicated across 25 employees and multiple pay periods.

Cost to fix initially: $0 (her payroll company could have added it).
Cost to fix in a lawsuit: $80,000 settlement + $30,000 in legal fees.

Maria's not alone. In 2025, PAGA lawsuits hit record numbers. The most common violations?

⚠️ Pay stub errors (like Maria's)
⚠️ Meal break timing issues
⚠️ Missing harassment training
⚠️ Incomplete personnel files
⚠️ Improper expense reimbursement

Here's what frustrates me: EVERY ONE of these is preventable with a simple audit.

After settling her lawsuit, Maria hired us. We found 12 more violations she didn't know about. We fixed all of them in 30 days.

Her quote: "I wish I'd known about you before the lawsuit. This audit would have paid for itself 100 times over."

THE LESSON:

Don't wait for a PAGA lawsuit to audit your compliance. The cost of prevention is always less than the cost of litigation.

→ GET YOUR FREE PAGA VULNERABILITY CHECKLIST:

I've created a simple 10-question assessment that reveals your biggest PAGA risks. Takes 5 minutes. Could save you $50,000+.

Tomorrow: I'll explain the 2026 mandate changes and what they mean for your business specifically.

Stay safe out there,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you're thinking "I don't have time for an audit"—I get it. But PAGA plaintiffs' attorneys have LOTS of time to review your pay stubs. Just saying.

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Have you distributed your SB 294 notices yet?

If not, you have [X] days until the February 1, 2026 deadline.

"But I don't even know what SB 294 is!"

Don't worry—you're not alone. Here's the 30-second explanation:

WHAT: California requires you to give every employee an annual "Know Your Rights" notice explaining their workplace rights.

WHEN: February 1, 2026 (then annually every February 1)

WHO: Every California employer (yes, even you)

PENALTY: $500 per employee for first offense, $750+ for repeat violations

For a 20-person business, that's $10,000-$15,000 for missing one deadline.

YOUR 5-STEP ACTION PLAN:

☐ STEP 1: Download official notice template (English/Spanish)
   Time: 2 minutes → [LINK]

☐ STEP 2: Add your company name and contact info
   Time: 5 minutes

☐ STEP 3: Print or email to all employees
   Time: 30 minutes

☐ STEP 4: Collect signed acknowledgments
   Time: 1 week (ongoing)

☐ STEP 5: File acknowledgments for 3 years
   Time: 15 minutes

TOTAL TIME: 2-3 hours to protect your business from $10,000+ in penalties.

NEED HELP? We offer a managed SB 294 service:
- We customize the notice
- We distribute to your employees
- We track all acknowledgments
- We maintain records for 3 years

Cost: $99-$299 (depending on company size)
Savings: $10,000+ in potential penalties

→ Learn more about managed service: [LINK]

OR just download the free template and DIY: [LINK]

Either way, don't miss this deadline. Cal/OSHA doesn't care if "you didn't know."

Tomorrow: Special consultation offer (expires Sunday).

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. New hire? They get the notice within 7 days of starting. Set up a system now so you don't forget later.

Hi [First Name],

We've covered a lot this week:
✓ Your 2026 compliance calendar
✓ Free templates and resources
✓ The PAGA risks facing LA businesses
✓ The urgent February 1 deadline

But here's what we haven't done: talked about YOUR specific situation.

Every business is different. Your industry, size, location, and employee demographics create unique compliance requirements.

That's why I'd like to offer you a FREE 30-minute compliance consultation.

WHAT WE'LL COVER:

✓ Your biggest compliance risks (specific to your business)
✓ What's required vs. what's optional
✓ A prioritized action plan with deadlines
✓ Resources you can implement immediately
✓ Whether you need professional help (honest assessment)

NO SALES PITCH. NO PRESSURE.

Just an honest conversation about where you stand and what you need to do.

I've helped over 500 LA businesses navigate California compliance. I've seen every scenario, solved every problem, and learned where businesses typically need help vs. where they can DIY.

My goal: By the end of our call, you'll have clarity on exactly what to do next.

→ BOOK YOUR FREE 30-MINUTE CONSULTATION:

[View Available Times] [LINK]

BONUS: Everyone who books gets my "2026 Compliance Starter Kit" ($99 value):
- Complete SB 294 packet
- SB 553 plan template
- Harassment policy template
- PAGA audit checklist
- Access to monthly compliance webinars

THIS OFFER EXPIRES: Sunday, [DATE] at midnight

After that, consultations go back to $299.

Why am I doing this?

Because I genuinely believe most compliance problems stem from lack of information, not lack of care. Business owners don't intentionally violate labor laws—they just don't know what's required.

I want to fix that.

P.S. Can't meet this week? No problem. Reply to this email and we'll find a time that works for you.

P.P.S. Seriously—no sales pitch. If you just need templates, I'll point you to free resources. If you need help, I'll tell you exactly what kind. Either way, you'll leave with a clear plan.

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: What stopped you from finishing the compliance audit?

Was it:
→ Too long? (It's actually just 10 questions - 5 minutes)
→ Not sure if it's worth it? (Fair question - let me answer that)
→ Got interrupted? (Life happens - pick up where you left off)

Here's what you'll get when you complete it:

✓ Personalized risk score (High/Medium/Low)
✓ Specific violations found in your situation
✓ Estimated financial exposure (e.g., "This could cost $25K in a lawsuit")
✓ Prioritized fix-it checklist
✓ Free templates to address issues immediately

One business owner told me: "I thought we were compliant. This audit found 7 issues I didn't know existed. Fixed them all before we got sued."

Worth 5 minutes of your time?

"Is this really necessary?"

Here's what I know: In 2025, PAGA lawsuits in California reached an all-time high. The average settlement for small businesses was $80,000-$120,000.

The violations? Usually simple things like:
- Incomplete pay stubs (Maria's story from earlier)
- Missed meal breaks
- Improper job classifications
- Missing harassment training

Every one of these is detectable in a 5-minute audit.

Your choice:
→ Complete the audit, find issues, fix them ($0-$500)
→ Don't complete it, hope for the best ($0 or $80,000)

Which would you choose?

This is your last reminder. After this, I'll assume you've got it handled.

Best of luck,
