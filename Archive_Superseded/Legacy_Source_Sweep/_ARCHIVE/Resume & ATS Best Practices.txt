Resume Best Practices & ATS Optimization Guide
I. Formatting and Structure
* File Type: Always save and submit as a PDF unless otherwise specified to preserve formatting.
* Length: Aim for one page for every 10 years of experience. Two pages is a common maximum for non-academic roles.
* Font: Use a clean, professional, and legible font like Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, or Garamond. Font size should be between 10-12 points.
* Margins: Keep margins between 0.5" and 1".
* Sections: Standard sections are:
   1. Contact Information (Name, Phone, Email, LinkedIn URL, City/State)
   2. Professional Summary (3-4 lines tailored to the target job)
   3. Skills (A scannable list of hard and technical skills)
   4. Work Experience (Reverse-chronological order)
   5. Education
   6. (Optional) Certifications, Projects, Publications
II. ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization
* Keywords: Identify keywords from the job description (e.g., "data analysis," "project management," "Python," "Agile methodologies") and ensure they are naturally integrated into your resume's Skills and Work Experience sections.
* No Graphics or Tables: Avoid using images, charts, text boxes, or tables, as most ATS cannot parse them correctly.
* Standard Section Headings: Use conventional headings (e.g., "Work Experience" instead of "My Career Journey").
* Acronyms: Spell out acronyms first, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. E.g., "Customer Relationship Management (CRM)".
III. Content: Action Verbs & Quantification
* Action Verbs: Start every bullet point with a strong action verb (e.g., "Orchestrated," "Engineered," "Managed," "Analyzed," "Streamlined").
* Quantify Everything: Whenever possible, use numbers to show the scale and impact of your work.
   * Instead of: "Responsible for managing the team's budget."
   * Write: "Managed a departmental budget of $500K, reducing operational costs by 15% year-over-year through strategic vendor negotiations."
