Operational Architecture for the Neurodivergent Technical Professional: A Comprehensive Field Manual Against Fractal Planning and Yak Shaving
1. Executive Summary and Pathological Definitions
The intersection of high-functioning technical capability and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) creates a specific, paradoxical phenotype in professional environments. The technical professional—whether a software engineer, systems architect, data scientist, or DevOps specialist—possesses the cognitive capacity to model complex, multi-dimensional systems but frequently suffers from catastrophic failures in execution due to specific dysfunctions in executive filtering, temporal perception, and working memory management. This report serves as an exhaustive "Field Manual," moving beyond generic productivity advice to establish a rigorous, neurobiologically constrained operating system for the ADHD brain.
The central adversaries identified in this manual are "Fractal Planning" and "Yak Shaving" (or Dependency Hell). These are not merely habits of procrastination or laziness but structural failures in the brain’s ability to terminate search algorithms and manage dependency trees. For the technical professional, whose daily work involves manipulating abstract logic structures, these neural failures map directly onto software engineering concepts: stack overflows, infinite recursion loops, and dependency resolution failures.
1.1 Fractal Planning: The Recursive Failure Mode
Fractal planning is defined as the tendency to break a task down into sub-tasks, and then break those sub-tasks down further, entering a recursive loop where the planning phase expands infinitely, preventing the execution phase from ever beginning. In the ADHD brain, this is driven by a deficit in the "stopping rule" mechanism of the prefrontal cortex. The brain cannot determine when a plan is "sufficient," leading to infinite granularization.
This phenomenon typically follows a recognizable emotional trajectory identified in psychological literature:
1. Uninformed Optimism: The subject experiences a dopamine surge upon conceiving the project, envisioning the final result without accounting for the granular steps required.
2. Informed Pessimism: As the planning begins, the sheer volume of dependencies becomes apparent. The "Fractal" opens up, revealing complexity at every scale.
3. The Crisis of Meaning: The working memory, overloaded by the expanding tree of sub-tasks, drops the root context (the "Why"). The professional finds themselves arguing about linter configurations while the application deployment (the primary goal) is forgotten.
4. Crash and Burn: The cognitive load exceeds metabolic limits, resulting in executive shutdown or "burnout".
For the software engineer, this manifests as over-engineering the solution before a single line of code is written. The subject does not simply "write a script"; they plan the library structure, then the testing framework, then the documentation standard, recursively descending until the cognitive load triggers an avoidance response.
1.2 Yak Shaving and Dependency Hell
Distinct from fractal planning, "Yak Shaving" refers to the phenomenon where a trivial task requires a prerequisite, which requires another prerequisite, forming a dependency chain that leads the professional far afield from the original objective. The canonical example involves a desire to wax a car leading to a need to fix a hose, which requires a washer, which requires borrowing a tool from a neighbor, which requires returning a borrowed pillow, which requires restuffing the pillow with yak hair, resulting in the individual shaving a yak at the zoo instead of waxing the car.
In technical contexts, this is synonymous with "Dependency Hell," where bugs in development tools, compiler errors, or complex merge conflicts derail the primary objective. For the ADHD brain, which struggles with goal maintenance, each step in the yak shaving process increases the probability of forgetting the original intent. The "stack" overflows, resulting in days of activity with zero progress on the primary deliverable.
1.3 The Phenomenon of Toolsmithing
A critical vulnerability in the technical ADHD phenotype is "Toolsmithing"—the act of building or configuring productivity tools rather than doing the work. This is a form of displacement activity where the dopamine hit of "optimizing" feels like work but produces no value. The technical professional will often reject standard tools in favor of building a "snowflake" system—custom scripts, cron jobs, and text files—justifying it as efficiency while engaging in procrastination. This manual strictly prohibits recreational toolsmithing, prescribing instead a rigid set of off-the-shelf tools (goblin.tools, Tiimo, Brain.fm, Minimal, TimeBloc) configured to act as an external prefrontal cortex.
2. The Neural Interface: Digital Exoskeletons for Executive Function
To combat the pathologies described above, the ADHD technical professional must utilize a "digital exoskeleton"—a suite of tools selected not for their features, but for their ability to impose external constraints on a brain that lacks internal inhibition. The selection criteria for these tools prioritize low-latency interaction, visual persistence, and the reduction of cognitive load through AI assistance.
2.1 goblin.tools: The Anti-Fractal Engine
The primary defense against Fractal Planning is the externalization of the breakdown process. The ADHD brain struggles to estimate the "weight" of a task, viewing "deploy web app" as a single, insurmountable monolith or an infinite fractal of terror.
Mechanism of Action: goblin.tools utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform "Magic ToDo" breaking down. It takes a high-level intent (e.g., "build a React component") and automatically generates the sub-steps. This bypasses the user's internal fractal loop. The user is not allowed to plan; they are only allowed to execute the steps provided by the AI.
Tactical Application:
1. The Brain Dump: When the user feels the onset of "Crisis of Meaning" , they must immediately input the paralyzing task into the goblin.tools Compiler. This tool takes a disorganized "brain dump" and structures it into actionable items.
2. Recursion Limiter: The tool breaks the task into single-step actions. Crucially, the user must accept the AI's breakdown as the "Canonical Truth," ignoring their own desire to add nuanced sub-steps. The "Spiciness" slider allows the user to adjust the granularity of the breakdown, but the control is external, not internal.
3. Tone Calibration: Technical professionals often suffer from Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), leading to over-editing emails to ensure they don't sound aggressive. The "Judge" and "Formalizer" tools in the suite act as a tone-check, preventing the "email rewriting" yak shave.
Neurobiological Constraint: By offloading the decomposition logic to the AI, the user preserves executive function fuel (glucose/dopamine) for the actual execution. The tool acts as a "spiciness" reducer for tasks, making them palatable to the dopamine-deprived brain.
2.2 Tiimo: Visualizing Temporal Architecture
ADHD brains suffer from "Time Blindness"—the inability to sense the passage of time or estimate duration. Standard to-do lists fail because they are lists of intent, not allocations of time. Tiimo serves as a visual prosthesis for the temporal lobe.
Mechanism of Action: Tiimo utilizes a visual, timeline-based approach where tasks are represented as blocks of time, not check-boxes. It integrates a visual countdown timer, anchoring the user in the present moment.
The "Move Unfinished Tasks" Protocol: A critical failure mode in planning is the "Wall of Shame"—a list of overdue tasks that grows until the user abandons the planner entirely. Tiimo addresses this with a specific "End of Day" check-in that allows for the one-tap migration of unfinished tasks. This feature is psycho-protective; it prevents the emotional accumulation of failure that triggers avoidance behaviors.
Tactical Application:
1. The Co-Planner: The user utilizes Tiimo's AI Co-Planner to import the brain dump. The AI estimates durations, preventing the "Uninformed Optimism" of assuming a 4-hour coding task will take 20 minutes.
2. Visual Anchoring: The app is kept open on a secondary display or widget. The visual countdown creates a "soft urgency" that mimics the adrenaline of a deadline without the cortisol spike of a crisis.
3. Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling: When a "Yak Shave" occurs and the schedule breaks, the user must physically drag the incomplete task block to a new time slot. This kinetic interaction forces the user to acknowledge the time cost of the distraction.
2.3 Brain.fm: Auditory Phase-Locking
For the ADHD brain, silence is often deafening, filled with internal chatter. Standard music (lyrics, variable tempo) creates distraction. Brain.fm provides a neurobiological intervention through auditory driving.
Mechanism of Action: Brain.fm uses "Phase-Locking Neural Modulation," generating acoustic patterns that entrain neural oscillations to specific frequencies (Beta/Gamma for focus). This is distinct from binaural beats; it uses modulation of the sound envelope to trigger strong neural responses.
The ADHD Mode: The platform includes a specific "ADHD Mode" which provides extra stimulation. The ADHD brain is under-stimulated; it fidgets to generate arousal. Brain.fm's ADHD mode acts as a "sonic fidget spinner," occupying the distraction-seeking circuits of the brain so the executive centers can focus.
Tactical Application:
1. Conditioned Response: The user must listen to Brain.fm only when working. This builds a Pavlovian response where the onset of the Neural Effect triggers a "Deep Work" state within minutes.
2. Intensity Modulation: During high-focus coding, the "Boost" setting is engaged. During administrative tasks (email), the intensity is lowered.
3. The Minimalist Protocol: Counter-Hoarding Measures
A secondary pathology in Technical ADHD is "Digital Hoarding"—the accumulation of notes, browser tabs, and documentation "just in case." This clutters the workspace, increasing cognitive load and inducing paralysis.
3.1 Minimal: The Ephemeral Note
Standard note apps (Evernote, Notion, Obsidian) encourage hoarding. They become "Graveyards of Good Intentions." The Minimal app introduces the concept of "Note Lifetime".
Mechanism of Action: Minimal implements a "Garbage Collection" feature for thoughts. If a note is unedited for a user-defined period (e.g., 7 days), it fades and is eventually deleted (or archived) automatically.
Tactical Application:
1. The Scratchpad: All transient thoughts ("check that library," "email Bob") go into Minimal.
2. The Filter: If the thought is important, the user will act on it or pin it before the timer expires. If it expires, the system decides it was noise, not signal.
3. Reduction of backlog anxiety: The user is freed from the obligation to "process" old notes. The system cleans itself, maintaining a "blank page" state that encourages new thinking rather than reviewing old guilt.
4. Operational Workflows: The Field Manual
This section synthesizes the tools into concrete workflows for the technical professional.
4.1 Morning Initialization Routine (The "Boot Sequence")
The transition from sleep to work is the most dangerous period for ADHD dysfunction. Without a boot sequence, the brain defaults to "doom scrolling" or "yak shaving."
Step 1: The Analog Capture (Index Card Method) Before touching a keyboard, the user employs the "Index Card Method".
* Material: One 3x5 index card.
* Action: Write down the 3-5 absolute critical tasks for the day. No more.
* Constraint: Physical writing engages different neural pathways than typing, slowing down the fractal thinking process.
* The "Now" Box: Place the card in a physical box or stand labeled "Now". This creates a physical totem of the current objective.
Step 2: Digital Formalization (Tiimo & goblin.tools)
* Open goblin.tools Magic ToDo. Input the items from the index card. Let the AI break them down into steps.
* Open Tiimo. Transfer these steps into time blocks. Use the AI Co-Planner to estimate realistic durations (e.g., allocating 2 hours for a task the user thinks takes 30 mins).
* Rule: Leave 20% of the schedule empty as "Buffer Blocks" for the inevitable Yak Shaving.
Step 3: Neural Entrainment (Brain.fm)
* Put on noise-canceling headphones.
* Launch Brain.fm. Select "Focus" -> "Deep Work" -> "ADHD Mode" (High Intensity).
* Trigger: Do not remove headphones until the first 90-minute block is complete.
4.2 Handling the "Yak Shave" (The Interruption Protocol)
Scenario: You are deploying code (Task A). The deploy fails due to a library version (Task B). You need to update the library, but the package manager is broken (Task C).
The Protocol:
1. Recognize the Shave: When you hit Task C (two levels deep), a mental alarm must trigger.
2. The Minimalist Pause: Open Minimal. Type "Blocked on Package Manager."
3. The Fork:
   * Is fixing the package manager fast (<10 mins)? Do it.
   * Is it unknown? STOP.
4. Reschedule: Go to Tiimo. Drag the "Deploy" block to later in the day. Create a new block "Investigate Package Manager" for now.
5. Externalize: Paste the error into goblin.tools "Compiler" or "Judge" to strip emotional frustration and get a list of logical debug steps.
4.3 The "Toolsmithing" Prevention Protocol
When the urge arises to switch to a new to-do app (e.g., from Tiimo to Notion) or to write a Python script to automate a 5-minute task:
1. Identify the displacement: Recognize that this urge is anxiety about the actual work.
2. The "Manual First" Rule: You are not allowed to automate a task until you have performed it manually 10 times.
3. The "Stock Config" Rule: Use tools (like TimeBloc or Tiimo) in their default configuration. No custom CSS, no plugin development. If the tool doesn't work "out of the box," abandon it, do not fix it.
4.4 The "End of Day" Shutdown (preventing residue)
1. Tiimo Review: Use the "Check In" feature. Tap to move all unfinished tasks to "Tomorrow" or "Someday". Do not leave them red/overdue. 2. Minimal Review: Check the "Note Lifetime." Pin anything vital. Let the rest die.
2. **Physical Reset: Throw away the index card. A fresh card must be used tomorrow. This prevents the "carry-over guilt" of a half-checked list.
5. Advanced Tactics: TimeBloc and The Pomodoro Variant
For tasks requiring extreme immersion (e.g., kernel debugging, writing complex algorithms), the standard timeline may be too loose. The TimeBloc application is deployed here for its strict integration of Time Blocking and Pomodoro.
5.1 The TimeBloc "Routine" Feature
ADHD brains struggle with transition costs. TimeBloc allows for the creation of "Routines" (saved templates of blocks).
* The "Deep Code" Routine: 25m Code -> 5m Stretch -> 25m Code -> 5m Water.
* Automation: By saving this as a routine, the user reduces the executive function required to plan the break. They simply hit "Play" on the routine.
5.2 The Pomodoro Integration
TimeBloc and similar tools integrate the Pomodoro timer directly into the calendar block.
* The Constraint: The timer creates a "micro-deadline" every 25 minutes. This spikes dopamine/norepinephrine just enough to maintain focus without inducing panic.
* The Visual: Seeing the block physically shrink or the timer count down provides the "time prosthetics" necessary for the ADHD user.
5.3 Comparative Tool Analysis

	6. Strategic Philosophy: From Management to Engineering
The approach outlined here treats ADHD not as a character defect but as a system reliability issue. We apply engineering principles to the brain:
* Fractal Planning is a stack overflow; we solve it with Recursion Limiters (goblin.tools).
* Time Blindness is a latency issue; we solve it with Visual Monitoring (Tiimo/TimeBloc).
* Distraction is a signal-to-noise ratio issue; we solve it with Phase-Locking (Brain.fm).
* Hoarding is a garbage collection failure; we solve it with TTL (Time To Live) policies (Minimal).
By adhering to this "Daily Field Manual," the technical professional moves from a state of chaotic reaction to one of architectural control, leveraging their neurodivergent ability for hyperfocus while mitigating the structural risks of their neurology.
Section 1: The Neurobiology of Fractal Planning and Dependency Hell
To effectively combat the operational failures of the ADHD technical professional, one must first understand the underlying "hardware" limitations. The behaviors of Fractal Planning and Yak Shaving are not failures of will; they are failures of the brain's "Stopping Rules" and "Search Algorithms."
1.1 The Recursive Search Failure (Fractal Planning)
Fractal Planning is essentially a runaway recursive search algorithm. In a neurotypical brain, when tasked with "Build a Login Page," the brain retrieves a heuristic schema: "Input fields, Submit button, Database connection." It estimates the effort and begins.
In the ADHD brain, the schema retrieval is hyper-associative.
* "Login Page" triggers "Security."
* "Security" triggers "OAuth2 vs JWT."
* "JWT" triggers "Library Selection."
* "Library Selection" triggers "Open Source Maintenance Status."
The brain dives into each node, expanding it into a new tree of sub-tasks. This is the Fractal: self-similar complexity at every scale.
1.1.1 The Role of Working Memory
The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) acts as the "Stack" in this computing metaphor. It holds the context of where we are in the task execution. The ADHD brain has a limited "Stack Depth" (working memory capacity).
* The Overflow: When the planner descends 4-5 levels deep into the fractal (e.g., comparing hash functions for the JWT library), the PFC drops the pointer to the root task ("Build Login Page").
* The Crisis of Meaning: Once the root context is lost, the current task (comparing hash functions) loses its teleological purpose. The user feels sudden confusion and apathy—a "Crisis of Meaning". They question why they are doing this, feel overwhelmed by the expanding complexity, and "Crash and Burn".
1.1.2 Uninformed Optimism vs. Informed Pessimism
This cycle is driven by emotional regulation failures.
* Uninformed Optimism: The initial dopamine rush of "starting a project" blinds the user to the complexity.
* Informed Pessimism: As the fractal unfolds, the brain realizes the scope is infinite. The dopamine crashes.
* The "Scrum" Fallacy: Technical professionals often try to solve this with "Agile" or "Scrum". However, without strict neurological constraints, they simply fractalize the Scrum tickets. They create "Epics" that are actually entire operating systems, and "Stories" that are 3-week research projects.
1.2 The Dependency Hell Loop (Yak Shaving)
Yak Shaving represents a failure in Goal Maintenance and Inhibition.
1.2.1 The Dependency Graph
In software engineering, "Dependency Hell" occurs when software packages have conflicting requirements. In ADHD productivity, it occurs when a task T requires a prerequisite P_1, which requires P_2... P_n.
The ADHD brain treats all nodes in this graph as having equal weight.
* Goal: Deploy App (T).
* Blocker: Server Error (P_1).
* Blocker: SSH Key Invalid (P_2).
* Blocker: Laptop Battery Low (P_3).
* Blocker: Charger is in the other room (P_4).
A neurotypical brain creates a "Sub-Routine" for P_4 (get charger), executes it, and pops back to P_3. The ADHD brain, prone to distraction, sees the charger in the other room, sees a book next to it, and initiates a new thread (T_{new}). The stack is flushed. The original goal (T) is abandoned.
1.2.2 The "Shiny Object" as a Dopamine Source
Yak Shaving often involves "Toolsmithing" because solving technical blockers (fixing the SSH key, reinstalling the OS) provides immediate, high-frequency feedback (a dopamine drip), whereas the main task (writing the documentation for the App) is low-dopamine and abstract.
* Toolsmithing as Procrastination: The user justifies rebuilding their .vimrc or configuring their Linux window manager as "sharpening the saw." In reality, it is "Avoidance Coping." They are avoiding the anxiety of the main project by engaging in a low-stakes technical challenge.
* The "Perfect Tool" Fallacy: The belief that if one just finds the perfect time-blocking app (Dependency P_{tool}), the executive dysfunction will vanish. This leads to spending 3 weeks testing apps (TimeBloc vs Tiimo vs Minimal) instead of doing the work.
1.3 Neurobiological Constraints for the Manual
Based on this pathology, the "Field Manual" imposes the following strict constraints:
1. Externalized Stack: The user is never allowed to hold the plan in their head. It must be externalized (goblin.tools, Index Card).
2. Recursion Limits: We must artificially cap the depth of planning (e.g., "Depth 1" only).
3. Visual Time: Time must be physicalized (Tiimo/TimeBloc) to prevent the "infinite time" delusion.
4. Sensory Gating: Auditory inputs must be controlled to prevent "interrupt" signals (Brain.fm).
Section 2: Tactical Tooling - The Digital Exoskeleton
The "Digital Exoskeleton" concept is derived from the necessity to support the weakened executive functions of the ADHD brain. Just as a physical exoskeleton allows a person to lift weights beyond their biological capacity, these tools allow the ADHD professional to handle continuity and planning beyond their neurological baseline.
2.1 goblin.tools: The De-Fractalizer
goblin.tools is a suite of single-task AI tools designed specifically for neurodivergent brains. Its primary utility in this manual is Cognitive Offloading.
2.1.1 The "Magic ToDo" Generator
The "Magic ToDo" tool acts as a surrogate Prefrontal Cortex. When the user faces a task like "Refactor the legacy codebase," the fractal panic sets in.
* Input: "Refactor legacy code."
* Mechanism: The AI utilizes probability models to predict the logical sub-steps.
* Output: A flat list: "1. Identify dependencies. 2. Set up test harness. 3. Modularize utility functions."
* The Constraint: The user must treat this list as authoritative. They are permitted to adjust the "Spiciness" (granularity) slider to break items down further, but they are not allowed to manually architecture the plan. This prevents the user from entering the "Crisis of Meaning" loop.
2.1.2 The "Formalizer" and "Judge" (Social Engineering)
Technical professionals often struggle with tone interpretation and social calibration (comorbid Autism/ADHD traits). This leads to "Social Yak Shaving"—spending 45 minutes rewriting a Slack message to ensure it doesn't sound rude.
* The Judge: Interprets the tone of incoming text. "Is my boss angry or just brief?" -> The AI clarifies, reducing RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) anxiety.
* The Formalizer: Converts a "brain dump" of angry text into "Professional" or "Polite" output.
   * Input: "This code is garbage and broke the build."
   * Output: "The current submission has introduced regressions that affect the build stability."
   * Utility: Saves the user from the "emotional spiraling" that creates blockers.
2.2 Tiimo: The Visual Time-Space Enforcer
Tiimo is selected over standard calendars (Google/Outlook) because it represents time as a visual arc, reinforcing the passage of time for those with time blindness.
2.2.1 The "Co-Planner" and Task Initiation
Tiimo's AI Co-Planner addresses the "Starting Problem." ADHD brains register large tasks as threats.
* The Setup: The user dumps the list from goblin.tools into Tiimo.
* AI Estimation: Tiimo assigns time durations. Crucially, it visualizes these as colored blocks on a timeline.
* Micro-Starts: The visual planner encourages "micro-starts" (e.g., "Open IDE" - 5 mins). This lowers the activation energy required to begin, overcoming the "Wall of Awful".
2.2.2 The "Move Unfinished Tasks" Fail-Safe
The most critical feature for the "Fractal Planner" is the handling of failure. When a "Yak Shave" eats 4 hours of the day, the schedule is ruined. In rigid apps, this creates a mess of overdue notifications.
* The Feature: Tiimo’s "End of Day" check-in prompts the user to "Move Unfinished Tasks".
* The Psychology: This is a "Bankruptcy" mechanism. It acknowledges the debt (unfinished work) and restructures it instantly. The user drags the incomplete items to the next day's "waiting room" or timeline.
* Benefit: It prevents the "Ostrich Effect" (burying one's head in the sand) by making the rescheduling process low-friction and shame-free.
2.3 Brain.fm: The Acoustic Fence
Brain.fm serves as the sensory gating mechanism. ADHD brains cannot easily filter out background noise (auditory or internal thought-noise).
2.3.1 ADHD Mode and Neural Entrainment
Brain.fm differs from Spotify/YouTube "Lo-Fi" playlists. Lo-Fi is just relaxing; Brain.fm is functional.
* Patented Modulation: It uses rapid amplitude modulation to simulate "fidgeting" at a neural level.
* ADHD Mode: This mode provides more stimulation, not less. The ADHD brain is under-aroused (low dopamine/norepinephrine). It seeks stimulation. If the environment is too quiet, the brain generates distraction.
* The "Sonic Fidget Spinner": The audio provides a high-density sensory stream that occupies the "distraction scanning" circuits of the brain, allowing the executive circuits to lock onto the visual task.
2.3.2 The Conditioned "Flow" Trigger
* Protocol: The user must listen to Brain.fm only when attempting to work.
* Result: Over 1-2 weeks, the brain associates the specific acoustic signature of the "Focus" tracks with the state of concentration. Putting on the headphones becomes a somatic trigger for "Deep Work".
Section 3: The Minimalist Protocol - Combating Digital Hoarding
The tendency to "Yak Shave" is often fueled by a cluttered environment. If the user's note-taking app is full of 5,000 half-finished ideas, finding the relevant snippet for the current task becomes a search problem, triggering distraction.
3.1 Minimal: The Philosophy of Ephemerality
Minimal is an iOS/Mac app that enforces a "Note Lifetime."
3.1.1 The "Note Lifetime" Mechanic
* Feature: Notes that are not edited or "pinned" within a set duration (default can be set, e.g., 3 days, 7 days, or 30 days) are automatically archived or deleted.
* The Anxiety: The ADHD brain hoards information "just in case." This leads to "Read Later" lists that are never read.
* The Solution: Minimal forces a decision. "Is this note important enough to Pin?"
   * Yes: It becomes a permanent resource.
   * No: It disappears.
* Cognitive Unloading: This mimics the "Short Term Memory" flush. It clears the workspace. When the user opens the app, they see a clean slate, not a list of failures from 3 years ago.
3.1.2 Tactical Implementation for Engineers
* Snippet Buffer: Use Minimal as a temporary buffer for code snippets or error logs while debugging a Yak Shave.
* Auto-Cleanup: Once the bug is fixed, the user usually forgets to delete the scratchpad. Minimal does it for them. This prevents the "Untitled Note 143" syndrome.
* Integration: Minimal syncs via iCloud but maintains a distraction-free interface (no folders, no tags visible by default), preventing "Organization Procrastination" (spending hours tagging notes instead of writing code).
Section 4: Time Blocking & Temporal Architecture
While Tiimo handles the "Daily Flow," TimeBloc offers a more rigid architectural approach, specifically useful for "Deep Work" sessions where the "Fractal" tendency is highest.
4.1 TimeBloc and the Pomodoro Integration
TimeBloc combines the vertical timeline (like Tiimo) with strict Pomodoro timers.
4.1.1 The Pomodoro Containment Field
Fractal Planning thrives on "Infinite Time." If the user feels they have "all day" to code a feature, they will fractalize the planning.
* The Fix: TimeBloc allows the user to tag a block with a "Focus Timer" (Pomodoro).
* The 25-Minute Bounding Box: The user is committed to only working on the immediate sub-task for 25 minutes.
* Fractal prevention: You cannot redesign the entire system in 25 minutes. You can only write one function. The timer forces a "Depth-First Search" (completion) rather than "Breadth-First Search" (planning).
4.1.2 Routine Stacking
TimeBloc excels at "Routines"—saved sequences of blocks.
* The "Boot Up" Routine: 15m Email -> 15m Standup Prep -> 5m Coffee.
* The "Decomp" Routine: 10m Documentation -> 5m Git Commit -> 5m Cleanup.
* Utility: The ADHD brain fatigues when making decisions. By saving these routines, the user automates the structure of their day. They don't have to decide "what to do next"; they just execute the pre-loaded routine.
Section 5: Analog Fail-Safes and Physicality
Despite the power of AI and apps, the ADHD brain can sometimes be over-stimulated by screens. The "Field Manual" mandates analog backups.
5.1 The Index Card Method (3x5)
This method, popularized by productivity experts, restricts the "scope" of the day to the physical dimensions of a 3x5 inch card.
5.1.1 The Spatial Constraint
* Rule: You can only list what fits on one side of the card.
* Effect: This physical constraint prevents the "List of Doom" (a to-do list with 40 items). It forces prioritization before the work starts.
* Latency-Free: Paper has zero latency. It has no notifications. It cannot open a browser tab. It is the ultimate "Single Task" device.
5.2 The "Now" and "Later" Box
To combat Object Permanence issues (if I put the task away, it ceases to exist), the manual recommends a physical "Inbox" system on the desk.
* The "Now" Box: A small stand holding the single Index Card or sticky note currently being executed.
* The "Later" Box: A physical box where "Yak Shave" ideas (e.g., "I should buy a new keyboard") are written down and dropped.
* Mechanism: This satisfies the impulse to "not forget" the idea, without allowing it to derail the current "Now" task. It physically separates the "Current Context" from the "Interrupt Context".
Section 6: Operational Workflows - The Daily Protocol
This section integrates the tools into a unified operating procedure.
6.1 Phase 1: The Morning Boot (08:00 - 09:00)
Goal: Establish Context and Dopamine Baseline. Tools: Minimal, goblin.tools, Index Card.
1. Brain Dump (Digital): Open Minimal. Type out every anxiety, task, and vague idea in your head. Clear the RAM.
2. Sanitization (AI): Copy complex tasks into goblin.tools Magic ToDo. Break them down to "Spiciness Level 2" (moderate detail).
3. Selection (Analog): Select the top 3 task clusters. Write them on the Index Card. Place card in "Now" stand.
4. Scheduling (Visual): Open Tiimo. Block time for the 3 tasks. Add a "Buffer Block" (1 hour) for inevitable chaos.
6.2 Phase 2: Deep Work Execution (09:00 - 12:00)
Goal: Execution without Recursion. Tools: Brain.fm, TimeBloc/Tiimo.
1. Sensory Lock: Engage Brain.fm (ADHD Mode).
2. Timer: Start the task block in Tiimo or the Pomodoro in TimeBloc.
3. The Anti-Fractal Rule: If you encounter a sub-task that will take >15 minutes, you are not allowed to do it. You must write it on a sticky note, put it in the "Later" box, and continue the main task.
   * Exception: If it is a "Blocker" (Dependency Hell), initiate Protocol 4.2 (The Fork).
6.3 Phase 3: The Interruption Recovery (The "Yak" Protocol)
Scenario: You fell down a rabbit hole. You spent 2 hours debugging a font rendering issue instead of shipping the database schema. Tools: Tiimo (Move Tasks), goblin.tools (Judge).
1. Forgiveness: Do not self-flagellate. The neurochemistry of ADHD makes this inevitable.
2. The Drag: Open Tiimo. Physically drag the "Database Schema" block to tomorrow.
3. The Re-Label: Rename the past 2 hours in Tiimo to "Unexpected Debugging." (Data logging, not failure).
4. The Reset: Stand up. Walk away. Reset the physiology. Return and start a new block.
6.4 Phase 4: Shutdown and Garbage Collection (17:00)
Goal: Prevent Residue. Tools: Minimal, Tiimo.
1. Digital GC: Open Minimal. Look at the morning brain dump. Did you pin anything? If not, let the "Note Lifetime" kill it.
2. Temporal GC: Open Tiimo. Use "Move Unfinished Tasks" to push everything left over to a specific slot later in the week.
3. Analog GC: Tear up the Index Card. The day is done.
Section 7: Advanced Troubleshooting
7.1 "Uninformed Optimism" and the Estimation Fallacy
Problem: You blocked 1 hour for a task that took 6 hours. Solution: The "Pi Rule."
* ADHD brains underestimate time by a factor of \pi (roughly 3x).
* When using Tiimo, if you think a task is "1 hour," you must schedule 3 hours.
* Use goblin.tools Estimator. Input the task, ask for an estimate. It acts as an unbiased third party. Trust the AI over your own gut.
7.2 The "Crash and Burn" (Dopamine Depletion)
Problem: After 3 days of hyperfocus, you cannot function. Solution: "Low Mode" Scheduling.
* Create a TimeBloc Routine called "Low Mode."
* Blocks: "Email Triage," "Documentation," "Learning."
* No "Creation" tasks.
* When you feel the crash, switch the schedule to "Low Mode." Do not try to force high-output work.
Conclusion
The "Daily ADHD Field Manual" is not a cure for ADHD. It is a containment strategy. By accepting the reality of Fractal Planning and Yak Shaving, the technical professional can stop fighting their own neurology and start managing it.
The tools selected—goblin.tools for decomposition, Tiimo for visualization, Brain.fm for stimulation, Minimal for anti-hoarding, and TimeBloc for containment—form a cohesive ecosystem. They replace the missing internal infrastructure of the Executive Function system with an external, digital scaffolding.
The victory is not in "fixing" the brain, but in engineering a workflow where the brain's bugs—hyper-associativity, novelty seeking, and time blindness—can no longer crash the system.
