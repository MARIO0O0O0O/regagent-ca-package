    <h2>IV. PROHIBITED CONDUCT</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Discrimination</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Discrimination</strong> is treating an individual or group differently in employment decisions based on a protected characteristic.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Prohibited discriminatory conduct includes:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hiring or recruitment:</strong> Refusing to hire, recruit, or interview based on protected status</li>
        <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Paying different wages or benefits based on protected status</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B. Harassment (Non-Sexual)</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Harassment</strong> is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile, intimidating, or offensive work environment, or that interferes with work performance.</p>
    
    <p>A <strong>hostile work environment</strong> exists when harassment is severe or pervasive enough that a reasonable person would find the work environment intimidating, hostile, or abusive, and the victim subjectively perceives it as such.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Prohibited harassment includes:</strong></p>
    
    <h4>Verbal Harassment:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Slurs, epithets, or derogatory comments based on protected characteristics</li>

        <li>Negative stereotyping or generalized statements about protected groups</li>
        <li>Mocking accent, speech patterns, or language</li>
        <li>Comments about physical appearance related to protected characteristics</li>
        <li>Repeated unwelcome social invitations after clear rejection</li>
        <li>Intrusive questions about protected characteristics (e.g., religious practices, medical conditions, immigration status, reproductive choices)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Visual Harassment:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying or circulating offensive images, cartoons, posters, or graffiti</li>
        <li>Sending offensive emails, text messages, or social media posts</li>
        <li>Using offensive screen savers, backgrounds, or avatars</li>
        <li>Making derogatory gestures</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Physical Harassment:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Unwanted touching, patting, or brushing against someone</li>
        <li>Assault or threats of physical harm</li>
        <li>Blocking movement or cornering someone</li>
        <li>Physical intimidation (standing too close, leaning over)</li>
        <li>Damaging personal property based on protected status</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Examples of non-sexual harassment:</strong>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.05in;">
            <li>Repeatedly telling jokes mocking a coworker's religion or religious practices</li>
            <li>Circulating cartoons depicting racial stereotypes</li>
            <li>Making repeated negative comments about older workers being "out of touch" or "behind the times"</li>
            <li>Mocking a coworker's accent or asking "where are you really from?"</li>
            <li>Making derogatory comments about an employee's pregnancy or suggesting they are less committed to work</li>
            <li>Asking intrusive questions about an employee's disability or medical treatment</li>
            <li>Commenting negatively on an employee's use of reproductive health services or reproductive loss leave</li>
            <li>Excluding an employee from team activities because of their sexual orientation</li>
            <li>Making negative comments about an employee's lawful off-duty cannabis use</li>
            <li>Repeatedly asking about criminal history after hire or making derogatory comments about past convictions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. Sexual Harassment</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Sexual harassment</strong> is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Under California law (Gov. Code § 12940(j)), sexual harassment includes two types of prohibited conduct:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment ("This for That")</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Quid pro quo harassment</strong> occurs when submission to or rejection of sexual conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting an individual.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.05in;">
            <li>A supervisor tells an employee that a promotion depends on going on a date</li>
            <li>A manager suggests that an employee's job security depends on tolerating sexual advances</li>
            <li>A supervisor offers preferential treatment (better assignments, schedule, pay) in exchange for sexual favors</li>
            <li>A supervisor retaliates against an employee who rejects sexual advances (poor performance review, demotion, termination, undesirable job assignment)</li>
            <li>A supervisor conditions training opportunities on acceptance of sexual propositions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning-box">
        Key point: Even a SINGLE INCIDENT of quid pro quo harassment can violate this policy and the law.
    </div>
    
    <h4>2. Hostile Work Environment Sexual Harassment</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Hostile environment sexual harassment</strong> occurs when unwelcome sexual conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 0.05in;"><strong>Verbal:</strong> Sexual comments about appearance, body, or clothing; sexual jokes or innuendos; sexually explicit stories; graphic descriptions of sexual activities; repeated requests for dates after clear rejection; making "kissing" or other sexual sounds; sexual nicknames or terms of endearment; intrusive questions about sexual life, preferences, or activities; discussing sexual conquests or experiences; rating attractiveness or sexual desirability</p>
        
        <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Displaying sexually suggestive posters, calendars, photographs, or screensavers; sending sexually explicit emails, texts, memes, or images; making sexual gestures; staring or leering at body parts; repeatedly looking someone up and down; displaying sexual content on personal devices visible to others</p>
        
        <p><strong>Physical:</strong> Unwanted touching (hugging, kissing, patting, rubbing, massaging); deliberately brushing against someone; blocking movement or cornering; sexual assault or attempted assault; grabbing or groping</p>
        
        <p><strong>Other:</strong> Following someone; waiting for someone; giving unwanted gifts of a romantic or sexual nature; love letters or notes after rejection; repeated attempts to establish romantic relationship after clear rejection</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Virtual/Remote Environment Examples:</strong>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.05in;">
            <li>Sending sexually suggestive messages via Slack, Teams, email, or text</li>
            <li>Making sexual comments during video calls about appearance, clothing, or home environment</li>
            <li>Sharing sexually explicit content in group chats or channels</li>
            <li>Making unwanted romantic advances via virtual communication</li>
            <li>Commenting on body or appearance during video meetings</li>
            <li>Using sexually suggestive virtual backgrounds or profile images</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Important Note:</strong> Sexual harassment can occur between individuals of any gender or sexual orientation. It can be committed by supervisors, coworkers, clients, vendors, or any other person in connection with work.
    </div>
    
    <h3>D. Retaliation</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Retaliation</strong> is any adverse action taken against an individual because they engaged in protected activity.</p>
    
    <h4>Protected Activities Include:</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reporting</strong> discrimination, harassment, or other violations (internally or to external agencies)</li>
        <li><strong>Filing a complaint</strong> with the California Civil Rights Department (CRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or other government agency</li>
        <li><strong>Participating in an investigation</strong> (as complainant, witness, or investigator)</li>
        <li><strong>Opposing unlawful practices</strong> (objecting to discriminatory conduct, refusing to follow discriminatory orders)</li>
        <li><strong>Requesting reasonable accommodation</strong> for disability or religious practice</li>
        <li><strong>Taking protected leave</strong> (FMLA, CFRA, sick leave, pregnancy disability leave, reproductive loss leave)</li>
        <li><strong>Requesting lactation breaks or accommodation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Filing a workers' compensation claim</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Whistleblowing</strong> (reporting violations of law, regulation, or public policy)</li>
        <li><strong>Engaging in union activity or protected concerted activity</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Forms of Retaliation (Examples):</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Termination, demotion, suspension, or other disciplinary action</li>
        <li>Denial of promotion, training, or advancement opportunities</li>
        <li>Negative or unjustified performance review</li>
        <li>Undesirable job assignment, transfer, or schedule change</li>
        <li>Reduction in hours, pay, or benefits</li>
        <li>Increased scrutiny, micromanagement, or unrealistic performance standards</li>
        <li>Exclusion from meetings, projects, or communications</li>
        <li>Hostile treatment, shunning, or social isolation</li>
        <li>Threats or intimidation</li>
        <li>Spreading rumors or making false statements</li>
        <li>Creating obstacles to performance (withholding resources, information, or support)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="warning-box">
        Critical Point: Retaliation is independently unlawful even if the underlying harassment or discrimination complaint is found to be unsubstantiated. Making a GOOD-FAITH COMPLAINT is protected, even if the investigation does not find a violation.
    </div>
    
    <h3>E. Inappropriate Conduct</h3>
    
    <p>Beyond conduct that violates the law, Sapphos discourages <strong>inappropriate workplace conduct</strong> that, while not necessarily severe or pervasive enough to constitute illegal harassment, is unprofessional and inconsistent with our values of respect and dignity.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Examples of inappropriate conduct:</strong>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.05in;">
            <li>Off-color jokes or comments (even if not directed at protected characteristic)</li>
            <li>Persistent unwelcome social invitations after polite decline</li>
            <li>Comments on physical appearance unrelated to work (even if not sexual)</li>
            <li>Gossip or rumors about coworkers' personal lives</li>
            <li>Exclusionary behavior or cliques that make coworkers feel unwelcome</li>
            <li>Condescending or dismissive treatment</li>
            <li>Yelling, cursing, or aggressive communication</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Employees who experience or witness inappropriate conduct are encouraged to report it</strong> so the Company can address issues before they escalate to unlawful harassment. Reports of inappropriate conduct will be handled confidentially and addressed through coaching, counseling, or other appropriate measures.</p>
    
    <h2>V. REPORTING PROCEDURES</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Duty to Report</h3>
    
    <p><strong>All employees are strongly encouraged to report</strong> any conduct that violates this policy or that they believe may violate this policy. <strong>You do not need to be certain</strong> that a violation has occurred. If you experience, witness, or become aware of conduct that may be discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, please report it.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        Early reporting allows the Company to investigate and address issues before they become severe.

    <h3>B. Multiple Reporting Channels – No Chain of Command Required</h3>
    
    <p>Sapphos provides <strong>multiple channels</strong> for reporting harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. <strong>You are NOT required to report to your immediate supervisor</strong>, especially if your supervisor is the alleged harasser or you are uncomfortable reporting to them.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You may report to any of the following:</strong></p>
    
    <h4>Internal Reporting Channels:</h4>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%;"><strong>1. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Officer</strong></td>

            <td>[PLACEHOLDER: ANONYMOUS_REPORTING_MECHANISM – e.g., dedicated email, hotline, online form]<br>
                <em>Note: While the Company accepts anonymous complaints, our ability to fully investigate may be limited if we cannot contact you for additional information.</em></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4>How to Make a Report:</h4>
    
    <p>Reports may be made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Verbally</strong> (in person, by phone, or via video call)</li>
        <li><strong>In writing</strong> (email, letter, or complaint form)</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymously</strong> [if mechanism available]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You do not need to use any particular format or form. Simply describe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What happened (the conduct that concerns you)</li>
        <li>When it happened (dates and times if possible)</li>
        <li>Where it happened (location, including virtual platforms if applicable)</li>
        <li>Who was involved (alleged harasser, witnesses)</li>
        <li>Any other relevant information (prior incidents, evidence such as emails or messages)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        All reports will be taken seriously and investigated promptly.
    </div>
    
    <h3>C. External Agency Filing</h3>
    
    <p><strong>You have the right to file a complaint with government agencies</strong> at any time, without first reporting to Sapphos. Filing with an external agency does not prevent the Company from conducting its own internal investigation.</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 40%;"><strong>California Civil Rights Department (CRD)</strong><br><em>(formerly Department of Fair Employment and Housing)</em></td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <div class="warning-box">
        You cannot be retaliated against for filing a complaint with CRD or EEOC.
    </div>
    
    <h3>D. Supervisor and Manager Mandatory Reporting Duty</h3>
    
    <p><strong>All supervisors and managers have a mandatory duty to report</strong> any harassment, discrimination, or retaliation they:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Witness directly</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Are told about</strong> by an employee (even if the employee asks them to keep it confidential)</li>
        <li><strong>Become aware of</strong> through any means</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Supervisors must report immediately</strong> (same business day if possible) to the EEO Officer at [PLACEHOLDER: EEO_OFFICER_CONTACT].</p>
    
    <p><strong>Supervisors CANNOT promise confidentiality</strong> to an employee making a complaint. If an employee asks you to keep a complaint confidential, you must explain:</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <em>"I understand this is difficult, but I am required by Company policy to report this to our EEO Officer. The investigation will be handled as confidentially as possible, but I cannot promise complete confidentiality because the Company has a duty to investigate."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="warning-box">
        Failure to report is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Under California law (Gov. Code § 12940(j)), supervisors can be held <strong>personally liable</strong> for harassment. Additionally, the Company can be held liable for harassment by supervisors that it knew or should have known about. Immediate reporting protects employees, supervisors, and the Company.</p>
    
    <h2>VI. INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Company's Commitment to Prompt Investigation</h3>

        <li><strong>Complainant notification:</strong> Complainant informed that investigation will proceed and that they are protected from retaliation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Phase 2: Investigation (Days 2-[TIMELINE])</h4>
    
    <p>The investigator will:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. Gather Evidence</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Emails, text messages, instant messages, social media posts</li>
        <li>Documents, photographs, videos, audio recordings</li>
        <li>Personnel files, performance reviews, attendance records</li>
        <li>Any other relevant physical or digital evidence</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>2. Conduct Interviews</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Complainant Interview:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detailed account of alleged conduct</li>
        <li>Specific incidents (dates, times, locations, witnesses)</li>
        <li>Impact on work and well-being</li>
        <li>Any prior complaints or attempts to resolve</li>
        <li>Witnesses or evidence to corroborate allegations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Respondent Interview:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Notification of allegations (with sufficient detail to respond)</li>
        <li>Opportunity to respond fully to each allegation</li>
        <li>Respondent's account of events</li>
        <li>Witnesses or evidence supporting respondent's version</li>
        <li>Due process: right to be heard and present evidence</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Witness Interviews:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Individuals identified by complainant or respondent</li>
        <li>Others with relevant knowledge</li>
        <li>Objective questioning to avoid bias</li>
        <li>Documentation of witness statements</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>3. Site Visits (if applicable)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Visit location where conduct allegedly occurred</li>
        <li>Assess visibility, accessibility, opportunity for conduct</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>4. Assess Credibility</strong></p>
    
    <p>The investigator will evaluate credibility using established factors:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inherent plausibility:</strong> Is the account internally consistent and logical?</li>
        <li><strong>Corroboration:</strong> Is the account supported by witnesses, documents, or other evidence?</li>
        <li><strong>Motive to lie or bias:</strong> Does the individual have a reason to be untruthful or exaggerate?</li>
        <li><strong>Perception and opportunity:</strong> Could the person have reasonably perceived what they describe? Were they in a position to observe or experience the conduct?</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Are statements consistent over time and across interviews?</li>
        <li><strong>Demeanor:</strong> (Used cautiously) Does the person appear candid and forthcoming?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Phase 3: Findings and Determination</h4>
    
    <p>The investigator will reach a determination using the <strong>preponderance of the evidence</strong> standard: <strong>Is it more likely than not that the alleged conduct occurred?</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Possible Findings:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sustained:</strong> The investigation found sufficient evidence that the alleged conduct occurred and violated this policy</li>
        <li><strong>Not Sustained:</strong> The investigation found insufficient evidence to determine whether the conduct occurred (inconclusive)</li>
        <li><strong>Unfounded:</strong> The investigation found evidence that the alleged conduct did not occur</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>The determination will be documented in a written investigation report</strong> that includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Summary of complaint</li>
        <li>Investigation steps taken</li>
        <li>Evidence reviewed</li>
        <li>Witnesses interviewed</li>
        <li>Credibility assessments</li>
        <li>Findings and conclusions</li>
        <li>Recommended remedial action (if violations found)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Phase 4: Remedial Action</h4>
    
    <p>If the investigation <strong>sustains</strong> the complaint (finds violations), the Company will take appropriate corrective action, which may include:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Discipline of the Harasser:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verbal or written warning</li>
        <li>Mandatory training or counseling</li>
        <li>Suspension (with or without pay)</li>
        <li>Demotion or reassignment</li>
        <li>Reduction in pay or benefits (if appropriate to circumstances)</li>
        <li><strong>Termination of employment</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The specific discipline will be determined based on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Severity and pervasiveness of the conduct</li>
        <li>Whether conduct was physical or verbal</li>
        <li>Position of the harasser (supervisors held to higher standard)</li>
        <li>Prior complaints or violations</li>
        <li>Impact on the victim</li>
        <li>Other relevant circumstances</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Other Corrective Measures:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Separation of parties (reassignment, schedule changes)</li>
        <li>Policy updates or clarifications</li>
        <li>Team or department-wide training</li>
        <li>Enhanced monitoring or supervision</li>
        <li>Restoration of benefits or opportunities denied due to harassment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>If the investigation does not sustain</strong> the complaint but reveals other policy violations (e.g., unprofessional conduct, inappropriate behavior), the Company may still take corrective action.</p>
    
    <h4>Phase 5: Notification</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Complainant Notification:</strong></p>
    <p>The complainant will be informed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>That the investigation is complete</li>
        <li>Whether the complaint was sustained, not sustained, or unfounded (general outcome)</li>
        <li>That appropriate action has been or will be taken (without specific details of discipline imposed on respondent, which is confidential)</li>
        <li>That they are protected from retaliation and should report any retaliatory conduct immediately</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Respondent Notification:</strong></p>
    <p>The respondent will be informed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>That the investigation is complete</li>
        <li>The findings (whether allegations were sustained, not sustained, or unfounded)</li>
        <li>Any disciplinary or corrective action being taken (respondent's own discipline)</li>
        <li>That retaliation is prohibited</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Specific details of discipline imposed on the respondent are confidential and will not be shared with the complainant unless necessary for safety or other compelling reasons.</p>
    
    <h4>Phase 6: Post-Investigation Monitoring</h4>
    
    <p>Following the investigation, the Company will:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitor for retaliation:</strong> Check in with complainant to ensure no retaliatory conduct occurs</li>
        <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Assess whether remedial measures are effective</li>
        <li><strong>Document:</strong> Maintain records of all follow-up actions</li>
        <li><strong>Respond promptly:</strong> If retaliation or additional issues arise, investigate immediately</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>E. Confidentiality</h3>
    
    <p>The Company will maintain confidentiality <strong>to the extent possible</strong> given its duty to investigate and comply with the law.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Information about the complaint and investigation will be shared only on a <strong>"need-to-know" basis</strong></li>
        <li>Need-to-know individuals include: complainant, respondent, witnesses, investigators, HR, legal counsel, management (if necessary for remedial action)</li>
        <li><strong>Participants in the investigation</strong> (complainant, respondent, witnesses) will be instructed not to discuss the investigation with others to protect privacy and the integrity of the process</li>
        <li><strong>However:</strong> Complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed because:
            <ul>
                <li>The Company must conduct a fair investigation, which requires interviewing the respondent and witnesses</li>
                <li>The Company may have legal obligations to disclose information (e.g., in response to subpoena or government investigation)</li>
                <li>The respondent has due process rights to know the allegations and respond</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>All investigation records</strong> (complaint, interview notes, evidence, investigative report) will be maintained in the <strong>Litigation/Investigations File</strong>, separate from personnel files, with access strictly limited to authorized personnel.</p>
    
    <h3>F. No Predetermined Outcome</h3>
    
    <p>The Company does not prejudge complaints. All investigations are conducted fairly and impartially. The investigator's role is to gather facts and reach an objective determination based on the evidence.</p>
    
    <h3>G. Good-Faith Participation</h3>
    
    <p>The Company expects all participants in an investigation (complainants, respondents, witnesses) to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Participate in good faith</li>
        <li>Provide truthful and complete information</li>
        <li>Cooperate with the investigator</li>
        <li>Maintain confidentiality as instructed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>However:</strong> Making a complaint in good faith—even if the investigation does not substantiate it—is <strong>not</strong> misconduct and <strong>does not</strong> subject the complainant to discipline. <strong>Good-faith complaints are protected from retaliation.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Knowingly making a false complaint</strong> (deliberately lying or fabricating allegations) is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action. However, the Company recognizes the difference between:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unsubstantiated complaints</strong> (insufficient evidence to determine what occurred) – <strong>NOT</strong> subject to discipline</li>
        <li><strong>False complaints made in bad faith</strong> (deliberate lies with intent to harm) – <strong>MAY</strong> be subject to discipline</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        When in doubt, report. The Company encourages reporting of any conduct that may violate this policy. You will not be disciplined for making a good-faith report, even if the investigation does not find a violation.
    </div>
    
    <h2>VII. REMEDIAL ACTION AND DISCIPLINE</h2>
    
    <p>Employees who violate this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The specific discipline will depend on the circumstances, including:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Nature and severity of the conduct</li>
        <li>Frequency and pervasiveness</li>
        <li>Whether conduct was physical or verbal</li>
        <li>Position of the harasser (supervisors are held to a higher standard)</li>
        <li>Prior complaints or corrective action</li>
        <li>Impact on the victim and workplace</li>
        <li>Other relevant factors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Discipline may include:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Coaching or counseling</li>
        <li>Mandatory training (harassment prevention, professionalism, anger management)</li>
        <li>Verbal warning (documented in file)</li>
        <li>Written warning</li>
        <li>Performance improvement plan</li>
        <li>Suspension (paid or unpaid)</li>
        <li>Demotion or reassignment</li>
        <li>Reduction in pay (if appropriate to circumstances)</li>
        <li><strong>Termination of employment</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Supervisors and managers who fail to report harassment</strong> or who engage in harassment or retaliation <strong>will be subject to discipline up to and including termination</strong>, given their heightened responsibilities and the serious consequences of supervisory misconduct.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Third parties</strong> (contractors, vendors, clients) who engage in harassment of Sapphos employees will be subject to appropriate action, which may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Communication with third party's employer or management</li>
        <li>Termination of contract or business relationship</li>
        <li>Exclusion from Sapphos premises or projects</li>
        <li>Reporting to appropriate authorities (if conduct is criminal)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IX. RETALIATION PROTECTIONS</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Zero Tolerance for Retaliation</h3>
    
    <div class="warning-box">
        Sapphos Environmental Inc. strictly prohibits retaliation against any individual who:
    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reports</strong> harassment, discrimination, or other policy violations (internally or externally)</li>
        <li><strong>Files a complaint</strong> with the California Civil Rights Department (CRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or other government agency</li>
        <li><strong>Participates in an investigation</strong> as a complainant, witness, or investigator</li>
        <li><strong>Opposes</strong> unlawful or unethical conduct</li>
        <li><strong>Requests reasonable accommodation</strong> for disability or religious practice</li>
        <li><strong>Takes protected leave</strong> (FMLA, CFRA, pregnancy disability leave, sick leave, reproductive loss leave, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Engages in other protected activity</strong> under California or federal law</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>B. What Constitutes Retaliation</h3>
    
    <p>Retaliation is <strong>any adverse action</strong> taken because an individual engaged in protected activity.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Adverse actions include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Termination, layoff, or constructive discharge (forcing someone to resign)</li>
        <li>Demotion, transfer to less desirable position, or reassignment</li>
        <li>Suspension or disciplinary action</li>
        <li>Denial of promotion, raise, or advancement opportunity</li>
        <li>Negative or unjustified performance evaluation</li>
        <li>Exclusion from meetings, projects, training, or communications</li>
        <li>Reduction in hours, pay, or benefits</li>
        <li>Undesirable shift or schedule changes</li>
        <li>Increased scrutiny, micromanagement, or unrealistic performance standards</li>
        <li>Hostile treatment, shunning, or social isolation by coworkers or management</li>
        <li>Spreading rumors or making defamatory statements</li>
        <li>Threats or intimidation</li>
        <li>Creating obstacles to job performance (withholding information, resources, or support)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Retaliation can be subtle.</strong> Even actions that seem minor (being excluded from a lunch meeting, receiving a suddenly critical email) can constitute retaliation if they are motivated by the individual's protected activity and would dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in protected activity.</p>
    
    <h3>C. Retaliation Is Independently Unlawful</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Retaliation is a separate violation</strong> from harassment or discrimination. Even if an investigation finds that the underlying harassment complaint was <strong>not substantiated</strong>, retaliation against the complainant is still <strong>unlawful and prohibited</strong>.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        Making a complaint in good faith protects you from retaliation, even if the investigation does not find a violation.
    </div>
    
    <h3>D. Reporting Retaliation</h3>
    
    <p>If you believe you have been retaliated against, <strong>report it immediately</strong> using the same reporting procedures outlined in Section V of this policy.</p>
    
    <p>The Company will investigate retaliation claims promptly and will take immediate corrective action if retaliation is found.</p>
    
    <h3>E. Consequences for Retaliation</h3>
    
    <p>Employees who engage in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action <strong>up to and including termination of employment</strong>.</p>
