## WHY SUPERVISOR TRAINING IS DIFFERENT

The law requires supervisors to receive **double the training** (2 hours vs. 1 hour) because supervisors carry significantly greater legal responsibility. This training adds:
- Vicarious employer liability — what it means for you personally
- Supervisor's duty to report (mandatory, not discretionary)
- Corrective action authority and procedures
- Documentation requirements
- Handling complaints from subordinates
- Managing the team after an investigation

---

## TRAINER QUALIFICATIONS

Same as employee training — see HP-TRAIN-EMP-001. Additionally, the trainer must have working knowledge of supervisory liability standards under California case law and the duty-to-report framework under FEHA.

## DETAILED FACILITATOR SCRIPT

### ⏱️ 0:00–0:05 — WELCOME & HOUSEKEEPING

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Welcome. My name is [YOUR NAME]. Today's session is specifically designed for supervisors and managers, so you will hear things that are different — and more extensive — than what your employees hear in their 1-hour session.
>
> The reason for that is simple: as a supervisor, you carry greater legal responsibility than the employees you supervise. What you do — and what you fail to do — has direct consequences for you personally and for [COMPANY NAME]. Today we're going to get specific about exactly what those responsibilities are.
>
> This is a 2-hour interactive session. I want real questions, real scenarios, and real discussion. That's the only way this training is actually useful."

---

### ⏱️ 0:05–0:20 — MODULE 1: LAW, LIABILITY & YOUR ROLE (15 min)

#### SLIDE: "What the Law Requires of You"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "AB 1825 was the first California law to specifically target supervisors for harassment training — because the legislature recognized that supervisors are both the most common perpetrators and the first line of defense.
>
> Your three core legal obligations as a supervisor are:
>
> First — you must not harass. That one should be obvious.
>
> Second — if you witness or learn about harassment, you have a mandatory duty to report it to HR. This is not optional. This is not a judgment call about whether you think the situation is serious enough. If you know about it, you report it. Period.
>
> Third — you must not retaliate, and you must actively prevent retaliation within your team."

#### SLIDE: "Vicarious Liability — What It Means for [COMPANY NAME]"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "When a supervisor harasses a subordinate, the employer is automatically liable. Not 'might be liable' — is liable. This is called vicarious liability. The employer cannot use the 'we didn't know' defense when a supervisor commits the harassment.
>
> This is different from coworker harassment, where the employer can defend itself if it had a policy, communicated it, and acted promptly when informed.
>
> For you, that means: your conduct as a supervisor directly and automatically exposes [COMPANY NAME] to liability. That's an enormous responsibility."

#### SLIDE: "Personal Liability — You Can Be Sued Individually"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "California is one of the few states where supervisors face personal liability under FEHA. Government Code Section 12940(j)(3) allows a harassment victim to sue you — individually — for harassment you commit, harassment you knew about and failed to report, retaliation you take or permit, or discouraging someone from filing a complaint.
>
> This is not a technicality. This is a real exposure. You can be named personally in a lawsuit even if the company is also named. This is one reason this training matters."

💬 **DISCUSSION:** "What's your gut reaction to the personal liability piece? Has anyone thought about it that way before?"
*(This is often a jarring reality for supervisors. Don't rush past it — let it land.)*

---

### ⏱️ 0:20–0:45 — MODULE 2: RECOGNIZING HARASSMENT (25 min)

**[FACILITATOR NOTE]:** This module covers the same substantive content as the employee training but adds supervisory context. Don't re-read the basics — move faster and go deeper.

#### SLIDE: "What Supervisors Often Miss"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "We're going to walk through harassment definitions more quickly than the employee session because you should already know the basics. What I want to focus on is what supervisors specifically miss — the gray areas that get companies into trouble.
>
> First gray area: 'Everyone was laughing.' Consent and participation aren't the same as comfort. Employees often participate in problematic behavior because they feel they have to — especially with supervisors. If jokes, memes, or comments of a sexual or protected-class nature are circulating, your silence as a supervisor is implicit endorsement.
>
> Second gray area: 'They're friends.' Friendship doesn't eliminate the power differential. A supervisor and subordinate friendship does not make sexual comments appropriate. The subordinate's apparent comfort may not reflect their actual comfort.
>
> Third gray area: 'It happened outside of work.' If conduct between coworkers outside of work creates a hostile or uncomfortable environment when they're back at work, it's your problem. Off-site, off-hours doesn't mean off the table."

💬 **SCENARIO A — SUPERVISOR SPECIFIC:**
> "One of your direct reports, Marcus, is well-liked and has been here 5 years. You've heard through a colleague that a newer employee, Jenna, mentioned feeling uncomfortable with the way Marcus jokes with her. You haven't directly witnessed anything. You haven't received a formal complaint.
>
> What do you do? And what should you NOT do?"

*(Expected discussion points: You can't ignore what you've 'heard.' You don't investigate yourself. You go to HR. You don't confront Marcus directly. You don't ask Jenna leading questions.)*

💬 **SCENARIO B — POWER DYNAMICS:**
> "You've noticed that two of your employees, Sam and Alex, seem to have developed a romantic interest in each other. They're peers — neither reports to the other. They seem mutually interested. No complaints have come to you.
>
> Do you need to do anything? What if one of them later gets promoted and now supervises the other?"

*(Key points: peer relationships need monitoring but not action unless they affect the workplace. If reporting relationship changes, the couple must disclose and HR addresses it. Don't shame consensual adult relationships, but do manage the power dynamic if it shifts.)*

---

### ⏱️ 0:45–1:05 — MODULE 3: RECEIVING & REPORTING COMPLAINTS (20 min)

#### SLIDE: "The Moment Someone Comes to You"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "One of the most important skills I'm going to give you today is knowing what to do in the first 5 minutes when an employee comes to you with a complaint. Because how you handle that moment sets the tone for everything that follows.
>
> Here is what that should look like:
>
> First — listen without interrupting. Don't problem-solve while they're talking. Don't offer opinions on the accused. Just listen.
>
> Second — thank them for coming to you. Acknowledge that it took courage. Do not minimize what they're sharing.
>
> Third — tell them what happens next: 'I'm going to report this to HR today. They will contact you to begin an investigation. This is confidential. You will not be retaliated against for coming to me.'
>
> Fourth — report to HR today. Not tomorrow. Not after you think about it. Today."

#### SLIDE: "What Supervisors Must NOT Do"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Here is the short list of what NOT to do:
>
> Do not investigate on your own. Do not interview witnesses. Do not confront the accused. Do not promise outcomes.
>
> Do not tell the employee not to talk to anyone. That would constitute obstruction and retaliation.
>
> Do not try to resolve it informally between the parties. What feels like a friendly resolution might be coerced.
>
> Do not take any action against either party — no reassignment, schedule changes, or any modifications — without HR direction.
>
> And absolutely do not share what the employee told you with other employees."

✏️ **ROLE-PLAY (5 minutes):**
> "I'd like two people to volunteer. One plays a supervisor, one plays an employee coming to report a situation. You'll have 3 minutes. Then we'll debrief."

Scenario for role-play: Employee tells supervisor that a coworker has been sending them messages outside of work hours that have become increasingly personal and uncomfortable. They're not sure it's a 'big deal' but it's bothering them.

*(Debrief: What did the supervisor do well? What would you have done differently? Did they listen without problem-solving? Did they give next steps? Did they commit to reporting to HR?)*

---

### ⏱️ 1:05–1:25 — MODULE 4: INVESTIGATION, DISCIPLINE & DOCUMENTATION (20 min)

#### SLIDE: "Your Role in the Investigation Process"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Once you've reported to HR, your primary job is to cooperate with the investigation and maintain a normal, functional work environment in the meantime.
>
> If HR directs you to implement an interim measure — a schedule change, a workspace adjustment, an administrative leave — do it without explanation to the broader team. Do not share investigation details with anyone who doesn't need to know.
>
> If HR interviews you, answer honestly and completely. Your job is not to protect the accused or the complainant — it's to tell HR what you observed.
>
> After the investigation, if discipline is imposed, implement it. Do not soften it, delay it, or announce it to the team."

#### SLIDE: "Documentation — What You Must Keep"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "As a supervisor, you should be documenting two categories of things related to harassment:
>
> First — any observed conduct or complaints that come to your attention, even informally. Date, what you observed or were told, who was present. Don't editorialize — document facts. Send it to HR immediately.
>
> Second — your response. What did you do with the information? When did you report it? These notes protect you personally if a claim arises later."

💬 **CASE STUDY DISCUSSION:**
> "Let's look at a scenario that went wrong. A supervisor received informal complaints about a manager's behavior over 18 months. The supervisor thought the manager would 'calm down.' The supervisor mentioned it to HR once in passing but never filed a formal report. The manager eventually was terminated after a formal complaint, and the victim sued.
>
> The supervisor was named in the lawsuit personally. The court found the supervisor's failure to formally report was a breach of the duty to act.
>
> What are the takeaways for how you operate?"

---

### ⏱️ 1:25–1:40 — MODULE 5: ABUSIVE CONDUCT & PREVENTION CULTURE (15 min)

#### SLIDE: "Abusive Conduct — AB 2053"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "California law specifically requires training on abusive conduct — also known as workplace bullying — since 2015. Abusive conduct is defined as conduct with malice that a reasonable person would find hostile and offensive, unrelated to legitimate business interests.
>
> This matters to you as a supervisor because: you can be the source of abusive conduct. Management style and abusive conduct are not always easy to distinguish, but the line exists.
>
> Legitimate: Setting high performance expectations, delivering honest feedback, holding people accountable.
>
> Abusive: Public humiliation, yelling, repeated personal attacks, isolating someone, assigning work designed to set up failure, taking credit for subordinates' work to damage their standing."

#### SLIDE: "Building a Prevention Culture"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "The best way to prevent harassment isn't policy — it's culture. And supervisors build culture every day through small actions.
>
> What that looks like in practice: you address inappropriate jokes or comments immediately — not after the meeting, not with a nudge later, but in the moment: 'Hey, that's not appropriate.' You model respectful communication. You make it easy for people to come to you with concerns without fear of being dismissed or of retaliation.
>
> Employees who trust their supervisor report problems early. Early reports mean small problems get fixed before they become lawsuits."

💬 **DISCUSSION:** "What's one thing in your current team environment you'd like to improve from a culture standpoint? Not a complaint — just something you want to be better at as a leader."
*(This shifts the tone from compliance to leadership identity. Often generates candid and valuable discussion.)*

---

### ⏱️ 1:40–1:55 — MODULE 6: COMPLEX SCENARIOS & Q&A (15 min)

Present 1–2 complex scenarios depending on time and discussion momentum. See HP-TRAIN-SHARED-SCENARIOS for the supervisor-level scenario bank. Prioritize:
- Scenarios involving protected leave and potential retaliation
- Scenarios where the accused is a high performer
- Scenarios involving investigations that find insufficient evidence

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "For the last 15 minutes, I want to open it up for any questions — and I also want to throw a couple of harder scenarios at you. These are the situations that tend to trip people up in real life."

**Supervisor Q&As to Prepare For:**
- *"What if the accused is my best performer and I'm worried about losing them?"* — Irrelevant to the investigation or discipline. Performance doesn't exempt anyone from the policy. Acting to protect a high performer from discipline is itself potential retaliation.
- *"What if the victim says they don't want to report?"* — Your duty to report exists independently of the victim's preference. You report to HR; HR decides how to proceed.
- *"What if I think the complaint is made up or in bad faith?"* — Report it. HR investigates. Determining bad faith is HR's job, not yours. You do not have authority to screen complaints.
- *"Can I tell my team that someone was disciplined?"* — No. You may not share details of investigations or discipline. Keep it confidential.

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "We're at time. Please sign the training roster and the policy acknowledgment form. You also have a supervisor-specific addendum in the acknowledgment that confirms your understanding of your reporting duties.
>
> Follow-up questions can go to [HR EMAIL]. You have 10 days.
