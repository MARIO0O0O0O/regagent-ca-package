- **Description**: Retail store, customer denied refund without receipt. Customer raises voice: "This is ridiculous! I want to speak to your manager NOW! You people are all incompetent!" Customer slams fist on counter. Other customers watching nervously.
- **Discussion Prompts**:
  1. What type of workplace violence is this? (Type 2: Customer/Client)
  2. What are the warning signs of potential escalation?
  3. How should employee respond using SAFER de-escalation?
  4. At what point should employee call for backup/security?

- **Facilitator Analysis**:
  - Type 2 violence (customer-on-worker)

**Scenario 2: Coworker Making Threats** (5 minutes)
- **Description**: Break room, employee Mark has been written up for tardiness. Mark tells coworker: "I'm so sick of this place. One more write-up and I'm going to lose it. They have no idea what I'm capable of." Mark has been increasingly isolated, stopped socializing with team.
- **Discussion Prompts**:

  2. What behavioral warning signs are present?
  3. What should the coworker who heard this do?
  4. Is this a reportable threat?
  5. What should the employer do?
- **Facilitator Analysis**:
  - Type 3 risk (worker-on-worker)
