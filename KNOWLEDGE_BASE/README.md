# KNOWLEDGE BASE
## Source Reference Library

This section contains the foundational research, prior-generation documents,
policy drafts, and reference materials that inform the compliance packages
in `COMPLIANCE_RESOURCES/`. It is the working archive — not customer-facing.

## How to Use This Section

The Knowledge Base serves three purposes for the web application:

**1. Research backing** — When a compliance package cites a statute or
regulation, the source document is likely in `VII_LEGAL_REFERENCES/`.
The web app can cross-link package citations to KB entries.

**2. Content seeding** — Blog posts, FAQs, and glossary entries in
`ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES/` are informed by material here. Writers and the
AI pipeline draw from this library when generating new content.

**3. Version history** — Prior-generation drafts in `I_POLICIES/` and
`II_TRAINING/` document the evolution of current package content.

## Important Notes

- This section is **not customer-facing**. Do not surface KB paths in
  public-facing web app routes.
- Files here use legacy naming conventions (`_v1.0_1_2_3_TEMPLATE.md` etc.)
  and have not been normalized.
- `VII_LEGAL_REFERENCES/` is the largest section (369 files) and contains
  the bulk of the legal research archive.
