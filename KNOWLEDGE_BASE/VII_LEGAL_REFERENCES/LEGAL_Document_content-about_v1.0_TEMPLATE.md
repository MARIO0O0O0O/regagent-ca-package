# About HRBiz

## Making California Compliance Accessible for Every LA Business

HRBiz was born from frustration—the kind every small business owner knows too well.

### The Problem We Saw

In 2019, our founder witnessed a friend's restaurant shut down after a PAGA lawsuit. The violation? Missing signatures on meal waiver forms. The cost? [AMOUNT] in settlements and legal fees.

The heartbreaking part? It could have been prevented with a 30-minute review.

That experience revealed something troubling about California's compliance landscape:

**The system assumes you know what you don't know.**

Senate bills pile up with cryptic titles (SB 294? SB 553? What do those even mean?). Deadlines come without warning. Penalties are severe, but guidance is expensive or confusing.

Small business owners were left with two bad options:
1. **Hire expensive attorneys** ([AMOUNT]-[AMOUNT]/hour for basic questions)
2. **Wing it and hope** (and face [AMOUNT]+ lawsuits when hope fails)

There had to be a better way.

## Our Solution: Compliance as Code

What if staying compliant was as simple as updating software?

HRBiz transforms California's complex labor mandates into:
- **Automated tracking** (we remember deadlines so you don't have to)
- **Plain English guides** (no law degree required)
- **Ready-to-use templates** (download, customize, done)
- **Expert support** (when you need human help)

We combine:
- **Technology** (automated reminders, digital tracking, certificate generation)
- **Education** (actually understandable training and guides)
- **Expertise** (real HR professionals, not just software)

The result? **LA businesses that move from liability to protection in hours, not months.**

---

## Our Approach: MPA-Level Standards, SME-Level Pricing

Our founder holds a Master of Public Administration (MPA) from [University]—the same credential used by senior government officials overseeing compliance programs.

We apply that government-level rigor to create systems that:
- Meet or exceed Cal/OSHA standards
- Survive DLSE audits
- Protect against PAGA lawsuits
- Actually make sense to implement

But unlike government consultants charging [AMOUNT]+ for policy reviews, we focus on:
- **Scalable templates** (help 1,000 businesses with one great template)
- **Technology automation** (software scales, consultants don't)
- **Self-service options** (free resources for those who can DIY)
- **Affordable support** (hourly rates, not retainer fees)

**Our pricing philosophy:** *Compliance shouldn't cost more than the potential penalty.*

---

## What Makes Us Different

### 1. We're Local

We don't serve "California businesses." We serve **Los Angeles businesses**—and we know the difference matters.

LA has compliance requirements beyond state law:
- Fair Chance Initiative for Hiring
- LA County minimum wage (higher than state)
- Industry-specific ordinances (hospitality, retail)
- Multi-city considerations (different rules in Santa Monica vs. Pasadena)

We track all of it for you.

### 2. We Actually Explain Things

No jargon. No legalese. No "consult your attorney" cop-outs.

When we say "SB 294 requires annual notice distribution," we also explain:
- What a "notice" actually is
- Where to get the official template
- How to distribute it (paper, email, or both?)
- What "acknowledgment" means
- Where to store the signed forms
- What to do if someone refuses to sign

**Our standard:** If a business owner can't implement it after reading our guide, we haven't explained it well enough.

### 3. We Offer Real Free Resources

Not "free trial" or "free consultation with purchase." Actual free resources:
- Downloadable compliance templates
- Implementation guides
- Blog posts explaining every mandate
- Self-assessment tools
- Email support for template questions

**Why?** Because 80% of compliance is information, not implementation. If a template and guide get you compliant, you don't need to pay us. We're okay with that.

For the 20% who need help? We're here with affordable services.

### 4. We're Compliance Nerds (Proudly)

We get excited about:
- The 2024 PAGA reform bill (it's actually business-friendly!)
- Properly formatted pay stubs (yes, really)
- Elegant emergency contact collection systems
- Well-organized personnel files

We read Cal/OSHA citations for fun. We attend DLSE webinars voluntarily. We have opinions about meal break timing.

This probably makes us weird. But it makes us **very good** at what we do.

---

## Our Mission

**Move 10,000 Los Angeles businesses from compliance liability to PAGA protection by 2027.**

Every business we help is:
- One fewer potential lawsuit
- One safer workplace for employees
- One less stress point for owners
- One more success story in LA's small business community

We measure success not by revenue, but by businesses protected.

---

## Our Values

### Expertise Without Ego
We know compliance inside and out. But we explain it like you're a friend, not a student.

### Education Over Sales
If you can solve it yourself with our free resources, we'll point you there—even if it means less revenue for us.

### Efficiency
Your time is valuable. We give you the shortest path to compliance, not the most billable one.

### Empowerment
We teach you *why* something matters, not just *what* to do. Understanding reduces fear and builds confidence.

### Integrity
We'll tell you when you don't need to hire us. We'll tell you when you do need a lawyer. We'll be honest about your risks even when it's uncomfortable.

### What Clients Say

> *"HRBiz saved my business. I had no idea we were so exposed to PAGA lawsuits. Their audit found 8 violations, we fixed them all, and two months later an employee filed a claim for the exact issues we'd just corrected. Because we had documentation of the fixes, the claim was dismissed. Worth every penny."*
> **— Maria R., Restaurant Owner, Downtown LA**

> *"Finally, someone who explains compliance in English instead of legalese. The SB 553 training was actually interesting—employees said it was the best safety training they'd ever had."*
> **— James C., HR [POSITION], Tech Company, Santa Monica**

> *"I used their free templates for everything and saved thousands. When I finally needed help with a complex accommodation issue, I paid for a consultation. One hour, [AMOUNT], problem solved. This is how consulting should work."*
