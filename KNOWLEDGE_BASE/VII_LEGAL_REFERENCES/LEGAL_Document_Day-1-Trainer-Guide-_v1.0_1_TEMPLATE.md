## 📖 SECTION 1: WELCOME & OVERVIEW (5 minutes)

### **Your Script:**

> "Good morning, Tina. Thank you for joining this project. Before we begin any audit work, I need to provide you with mandatory confidentiality training. This isn't optional - it's a legal requirement.
>
> Over the next 30 minutes, I'm going to explain:
> 1. Why confidentiality is critical in HR
> 2. What laws require us to protect employee information
> 3. Exactly what you can and cannot do with personnel files
> 4. The serious consequences of violating confidentiality
>
> At the end, you'll sign a confidentiality agreement. Do you have any questions before we start?"

### **Teaching Notes:**

✅ **Set serious tone** - This isn't bureaucratic paperwork; it's legal protection  
✅ **Emphasize "requirement"** - Not optional  
✅ **Preview certificate** - Mention she'll get HR 101 certificate at end of 23 days  
⚠️ **Watch for:** Tina looking nervous or overwhelmed - reassure her that with proper training, this is manageable

---

## 📖 SECTION 2: LEGAL FRAMEWORK (10 minutes)

### **2A: Why Confidentiality Matters (2 minutes)**

### **Your Script:**

> "HR deals with some of the most sensitive information in the company. We have access to:
> - Medical diagnoses and health conditions
> - Salary and compensation details
> - Disciplinary actions and investigations
> - Family situations (divorces, domestic violence, child custody)
> - Immigration status
> - Disability accommodations
>
> If this information gets out - even accidentally - it can:
> - Violate federal and state law
> - Result in lawsuits against the company
> - Harm employees personally
> - Get us both terminated
> - Even create personal legal liability for you
>
> That's why we take this so seriously."

### **Teaching Notes:**

✅ **Use real examples** (anonymized): "I once knew an HR person who casually mentioned an employee's medical condition in the break room. That employee sued. The HR person was terminated and personally named in the lawsuit."  
✅ **Make it personal:** "This protects YOU legally, not just the company"  
⚠️ **Don't scare excessively** - Balance seriousness with "you can do this with proper training"

---

### **2B: The Laws You Must Follow (8 minutes)**

**Show Visual Aid #1** (see Visual Aids section)

### **Your Script:**

> "There are three main federal laws that require confidentiality, plus California state law. Let me explain each one."

---

#### **ADA - Americans with Disabilities Act**

**Key Points to Cover:**

📌 **What it is:** Federal law prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities

📌 **Medical records requirement:**
- All medical information MUST be kept in separate, locked file
- Only people with "legitimate need to know" can access it
- You have a legitimate need for this audit - but ONLY to verify presence, not read details

📌 **What's covered:**
- Doctor's notes
- Medical certifications
- Disability accommodation requests
- Fitness-for-duty exams
- Drug test results

**Your Script:**

> "The ADA requires medical information to be kept completely separate from regular personnel files. It must be in a locked cabinet, and only specific people can access it.
>
> **Show Tina the locked medical file cabinet**
>
> For this audit, you'll help me verify that medical documents ARE in this separate file - but you won't be reading the actual medical information. We'll use a 'blind audit' approach where you check 'document present: yes or no' without reading the diagnosis or treatment details."

**Teaching Note:**  
✅ **Physical demonstration** - Actually show her the locked cabinet  
✅ **Explain "blind audit"** - This is the key safeguard

**Working Hyperlink:**
- Official EEOC ADA Guide: https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-disability-related-inquiries-and-medical-examinations-employees

---

#### **FMLA - Family and Medical Leave Act**

**Key Points to Cover:**

📌 **What it is:** Federal law giving employees up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for medical/family reasons

📌 **Confidentiality requirement:**
- Medical certifications supporting FMLA leave must be kept separately
- Same standards as ADA
- Cannot disclose employee's medical condition

📌 **What you'll see:**
- FMLA request forms
- Doctor certifications (DOL Form WH-380-E)
- Leave tracking documents

**Your Script:**

> "FMLA protects employees who need time off for serious medical conditions - their own or a family member's. When employees request FMLA leave, they submit medical certification from their doctor.
>
> Those certifications are highly confidential. They contain diagnoses, treatment plans, prognoses. You'll help me verify these forms exist and are filed properly - but again, you won't be reading the medical details."

**Working Hyperlink:**
- U.S. Department of Labor FMLA Guide: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla

---

#### **California CMIA - Confidentiality of Medical Information Act**

**Key Points to Cover:**

📌 **What it is:** California's additional layer of medical privacy protection

📌 **Stricter than federal law:** California often has tougher requirements

📌 **Penalties:** Civil penalties up to ,000 per violation + attorney's fees

**Your Script:**

> "California law adds extra protection on top of federal law. The Confidentiality of Medical Information Act makes it illegal to disclose medical information without authorization.
>
> Bottom line: California takes this even more seriously than federal law. We follow the strictest standard."

### **Teaching Note for Legal Framework Section:**

⏰ **Time check at 15 minutes** - You should be starting Section 3 now  
✅ **Check understanding:** "Does this make sense so far? Any questions?"  
⚠️ **Don't get bogged down in details** - Keep moving; she'll learn more over 23 days

---

## 📖 SECTION 3: WHAT TINA CAN/CANNOT DO (7 minutes)

**Show Visual Aid #2** (Tiered Access Chart)

### **Your Script:**

> "Now let's get practical. I'm going to show you exactly what you CAN do, and what you CANNOT do. We use a three-tier system."

---

### **TIER 1: Non-Confidential Files - TINA HANDLES INDEPENDENTLY**

**Show examples of actual documents (redact employee names if needed)**

✅ **TINA CAN:**
- Scan these documents
- Organize by category
- Create checklists
- Update tracking spreadsheets
- Work independently (I don't need to be present)

**Examples:**
- Job applications (non-medical portions)
- W-4 / DE-4 tax forms
- Direct deposit authorizations
- Handbook acknowledgments
- Training certificates
- Performance evaluations (non-medical)

**Your Script:**

> "These are standard business documents. There's nothing medically confidential here. You can handle these completely independently. Scan them, organize them, check them off the list - no problem."

---

### **TIER 2: Confidential Medical Files - TINA ASSISTS WITH SAFEGUARDS**

**Show example of blind audit checklist**

✅ **TINA CAN:**
- Verify **presence** of documents ("Is there a medical certification? Yes/No")
- Record **dates** (to check retention compliance)
- Count documents
- Organize files by category **without reading contents**
- Prepare files for Mario's review

❌ **TINA CANNOT:**
- Read medical certifications
- Note specific diagnoses
- Review doctor's notes
- Copy or photograph medical documents
- Discuss any medical information with anyone

**Your Script:**

> "For medical files, you'll use what I call a 'blind audit' approach. Let me show you an example.
>
> **Hand Tina the Blind Audit Checklist**
>
> You'll open the file, look for the document type - 'Is there an FMLA certification?' - check YES or NO, note the date it was signed, then close the file. You're verifying the document exists and checking the date for retention purposes, but you're NOT reading the employee's diagnosis or treatment.
>
> If you accidentally see medical information, that's okay - just don't read further, don't make notes about it, and don't discuss it. We'll talk about what to do if that happens."

**Teaching Note:**  
✅ **Practice with example** - Have a redacted sample file and walk through the blind audit process together

---

### **TIER 3: Investigation Files - MARIO ONLY**

**Show investigation file cabinet (if separate) or folder marked "CONFIDENTIAL - HR AUDITOR ONLY"**

❌ **TINA NEVER TOUCHES THESE:**
- Harassment complaints
- Discrimination investigations
- Witness statements
- Internal investigation notes
- Attorney-client privileged documents
- Pending disciplinary actions

**Your Script:**

> "These files are marked 'HR Auditor Only' or 'Confidential Investigation.' You will never access these. If you encounter one by accident, close it immediately and bring it to me. These involve active legal matters, and only I can handle them."

**Teaching Note:**  
✅ **Physical demonstration** - Show her the marked files  
✅ **Explain why** - "These could involve current lawsuits or pending discipline"

---

### **Practical Scenarios - Test Understanding**

**Your Script:**

> "Let me give you some scenarios. Tell me what you'd do."

**Scenario 1:**
> "You're scanning files and you find an FMLA medical certification that wasn't in the medical file cabinet - it's mixed in with the regular personnel file. What do you do?"

**Correct Answer:** Stop, don't read it, bring it to Mario immediately so he can move it to the proper file.

**Scenario 2:**
> "A coworker asks you, 'How's the audit going? Find anything interesting?' What do you say?"

**Correct Answer:** "The audit is progressing on schedule. I can't discuss specific employee information due to confidentiality requirements."

**Scenario 3:**
> "You accidentally read that an employee has diabetes while verifying an FMLA form. What do you do?"

**Correct Answer:** Don't make notes about it, don't discuss it with anyone. If it becomes an issue, mention to Mario that you inadvertently saw medical information, but don't repeat what it was.

**Teaching Note:**  
✅ **Praise correct answers** - Reinforce understanding  
⚠️ **If wrong answer** - Gently correct and explain why

---

## 📖 SECTION 4: CONSEQUENCES & QUESTIONS (5 minutes)

### **4A: What Happens If Confidentiality is Breached (3 minutes)**

**Show Visual Aid #3** (Consequences Flowchart)

**Your Script:**

> "I need to be very clear about what happens if confidentiality is violated - whether intentionally or accidentally."

**Consequences for the Company:**
- EEOC complaint or lawsuit
- State labor agency investigation
- Fines and penalties (,000-,000+ per violation in California)
- Damage to reputation

**Consequences for Mario (me):**
- Professional discipline
- Potential termination
- Legal liability as supervisor

**Consequences for Tina:**
- Immediate removal from project
- Written disciplinary action (goes in your permanent file)
- Potential termination
- Personal legal liability (you can be personally sued)

**Your Script:**

> "I'm not telling you this to scare you. I'm telling you because this is serious. But here's the good news: if you follow the training, ask questions when unsure, and use the tiered access system, you'll be fine.
>
> The people who get in trouble are the ones who:
> - Gossip about employee information
> - Take photos of documents to show friends
> - Discuss medical information in public areas
> - Access information out of curiosity, not business need
>
> You won't do any of those things, so you're going to be fine."

**Teaching Note:**  
✅ **Balance** - Serious but not terrifying  
✅ **Emphasize support** - "Ask me if you're ever unsure"

---

### **4B: Questions & Clarifications (2 minutes)**

**Your Script:**

> "Before we sign the agreement, do you have ANY questions? There are no stupid questions. It's better to ask now than to be unsure later."

**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "What if I accidentally see something confidential?"**  
A: "Don't panic. Just stop reading, don't make notes, close the file, and mention it to me. Accidental exposure happens - it's only a problem if you then disclose it or gossip about it."

**Q: "Can I tell my supervisor (outside this project) what I'm working on?"**  
A: "You can say you're assisting with a personnel file audit. You cannot discuss specific employees, medical information, or findings."

**Q: "What if someone asks me to look up information about a specific employee?"**  
A: "Unless it's me asking for a legitimate audit purpose, the answer is no. Refer them to me."

**Teaching Note:**  
✅ **Encourage questions** - This is critical understanding  
⏰ **Time check** - Should be at 27 minutes; 3 minutes left for signing

---

## 📖 SECTION 5: SIGN CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (3 minutes)

**Hand Tina the Confidentiality Agreement**

**Your Script:**

> "This agreement formalizes everything we just discussed. Please read it carefully. I'll give you a couple minutes, then we'll both sign."

**While Tina reads:**
- Stay quiet
- Let her read at her own pace
- Be available if she has questions

**After she finishes reading:**

**Your Script:**

> "Do you understand everything in this agreement? Any questions before you sign?"

**Once signed:**

**Your Script:**

> "Thank you, Tina. You're now officially authorized to assist with this audit. I'm confident you'll do great work.
>
> Remember:
> - When in doubt, ask me
> - Follow the tiered access system
> - Never discuss employee information outside this project
>
> We'll start actual audit work tomorrow. For now, let's review tomorrow's schedule."

**Give Tina:**
- Copy of signed agreement (for her records)
- Student workbook
- Day 2 assignment preview
