Perplexity Reconnaissance - CHUNK 3 of 3: Integration Intelligence
MISSION: Intelligence gathering ONLY. Find information about system integration, APIs, no-code tools, and effort estimation. Report facts. NO strategy, NO recommendations. Just raw intelligence for Gemini to synthesize.

CONTEXT: This is Chunk 3 of 3. You already gathered intelligence on:
- Chunk 1: Modules 1-5 systems
- Chunk 2: Modules 6-10 systems
Now: Gather intelligence on HOW to connect them.

- Cite sources (URLs to docs, blog posts, GitHub repos)
- If you can't find information, say "No information found"
- Focus on evidence (not speculation)
- Prioritize recent information (2023-2025)

END OF CHUNK 3. Proceed with intelligence gathering. This is raw data for Gemini to synthesize into strategy, which Claude will then use to create a 40-hour implementation blueprint.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR MARIO:
Step 1: Run Chunk 1 in Perplexity
Copy full Chunk 1 prompt
Paste into Perplexity
Save results as perplexity_chunk1_modules1-5.md
Step 2: Run Chunk 2 in Perplexity
Copy full Chunk 2 prompt
Paste into Perplexity
Save results as perplexity_chunk2_modules6-10.md
Step 3: Run Chunk 3 in Perplexity
Copy full Chunk 3 prompt
Paste into Perplexity
Save results as perplexity_chunk3_integration.md
Step 4: Send ALL 3 results to Gemini with this prompt:
I have reconnaissance data on 10 HRIS modules from Perplexity. Synthesize this into:
1. Top 3 architectural options (with specific systems for each module)
2. Integration approach for each option (how systems connect)
3. Gap analysis (what must be custom-built)
4. Effort estimate for each option (aim for 40-hour implementation)
5. California compliance assessment (federal/state/local)
6. Recommended option with rationale

Context: 47-employee environmental consulting firm, Gusto is payroll system of truth, need compliant HRIS using cloned repos + no-code tools.

[Paste all 3 Perplexity reports]
Step 5: Send Gemini's synthesis to Claude (me) with:
Create a 40-hour implementation blueprint based on Gemini's recommended architecture:
1. Exact repos to clone
2. Docker Compose configuration
3. n8n workflows needed
4. Gusto API integration steps
5. Compliance checklist (CA + federal)
6. Week-by-week implementation plan
7. Testing strategy
8. Go-live checklist

Make it actionable: commands to run, files to configure, step-by-step.
This three-stage approach:
Perplexity = Scout (gather intelligence)
Gemini = Strategist (synthesize options)
Claude = Architect (build blueprint)
Total time: 2-3 hours of prompt work → 40-hour implementation plan.
Claude is AI and can make mistakes.
Please double-check responses.
