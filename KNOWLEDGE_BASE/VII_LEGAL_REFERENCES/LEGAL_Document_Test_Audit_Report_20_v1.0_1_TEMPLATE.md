**Employee ID:** [Not Available - COMPLIANCE GAP]  
**Department:** [Not Available - COMPLIANCE GAP]  
**Position:** [Not Available - COMPLIANCE GAP]  
**Hire Date:** [Not Available - COMPLIANCE GAP]  

## Audit Date
[EFFECTIVE DATE]

## Documents Reviewed
- Personnel file contents (limited access)
- Payroll records review attempted
- Tax withholding documentation search conducted
- I-9 verification status check

## Findings

### Compliant Items
- None identified due to incomplete documentation access

### Missing Documents
**CRITICAL DEFICIENCY:**
- **Form W-4 (Employee's Withholding Certificate)** - **MISSING**
  - *Legal Requirement:* IRC Section 3402(f)(2)(A); Treasury Regulation 31.3402(f)(2)-1(a)
  - *Compliance Standard:* Must be completed before first wage payment
  - *Retention Requirement:* Maintain for 4 years after tax becomes due or is paid

**ADDITIONAL GAPS IDENTIFIED:**
- Employee identification number not documented
- Department/position classification unclear
- Hire date documentation unavailable
- Complete personnel file inaccessible for comprehensive review

### Compliance Gaps
- **Payroll Tax Withholding:** Without valid W-4, employer cannot determine proper federal income tax withholding amounts
- **Backup Withholding Risk:** Potential 24% backup withholding requirement under IRC Section 3406
- **Record Retention:** Inability to demonstrate compliance with federal record-keeping mandates

## Risk Assessment
**RISK LEVEL: HIGH**

**Rationale:**
- **IRS Penalties:** Failure to obtain W-4 may result in penalties under IRC Section 6721 (up to [AMOUNT] per form for 2025)
- **Incorrect Withholding Liability:** Employer may be held liable for under-withheld taxes
- **Audit Exposure:** Missing W-4 creates vulnerability during IRS or state tax authority examinations
- **DOL Compliance:** Incomplete personnel records may violate FLSA record-keeping requirements (29 CFR 516.2)
