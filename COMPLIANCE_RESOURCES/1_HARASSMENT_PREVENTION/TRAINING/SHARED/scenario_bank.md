# HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING — SCENARIO BANK
## HP-TRAIN-SHARED-SCENARIOS | Version 2.0

**Purpose:** Discussion scenarios for live training sessions. Used in both employee (HP-TRAIN-EMP-001) and supervisor (HP-TRAIN-SUP-001) sessions. Facilitators select scenarios based on audience, time, and discussion needs.

**Usage Notes:**
- Always read scenarios aloud — don't ask participants to read independently during webinars
- Scenarios are designed to provoke discussion, not have a single "correct" answer
- Follow each scenario with open-ended questions before providing legal framework
- For webinar: use polling tool or chat for initial responses before group discussion
- Adjust company/industry context to fit your audience

## CATEGORY 1: SEXUAL HARASSMENT — EMPLOYEE LEVEL

### Scenario E-1: "The Group Chat"
> A coworker frequently posts memes to the team group chat. Over the past few weeks, the memes have included increasingly sexual content — nothing overtly graphic, but comments with sexual innuendo. Several teammates laugh and react with emojis. One employee finds them offensive and has stopped engaging with the chat entirely.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Does this qualify as sexual harassment?
2. Does it matter that others seemed to enjoy it?
3. What should the employee who's uncomfortable do?
4. What should a supervisor do if they're in the chat and have seen the memes?

**Key Teaching Points:** Intent ≠ impact; pervasive pattern matters; the objecting employee is not required to speak up directly to the harasser; the supervisor in the chat has a reporting duty.

### Scenario E-2: "The Compliment"
> A manager tells a female employee: "You look really great today. That outfit is very... distracting." He's said similar things before — always framed as compliments. She's laughed it off each time but feels increasingly uncomfortable. She hasn't said anything because he's her boss and she doesn't want to make things awkward.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Is this sexual harassment?
2. Does her laughing it off affect the analysis?
3. What options does she have?
4. What does the manager risk by continuing this behavior?

**Key Teaching Points:** Victim's response to harassment doesn't determine whether it's harassment; supervisor-subordinate context increases severity; single comments may not rise to hostile environment but a pattern does; she can report even though she hasn't objected directly.

---

### Scenario E-3: "Outside of Work"
> Two coworkers, Jordan and Blake, follow each other on social media. Jordan begins sending Blake direct messages outside of work — initially about work topics, then increasingly personal. One message asks Blake on a date after Blake had already declined verbally at work. Blake shows you the messages and asks if this is a work problem since it happened outside of work.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Does the fact that this happened on personal accounts and after hours matter?
2. What do you tell Blake?
3. Is this potentially harassment?

**Key Teaching Points:** Personal channels between coworkers can constitute harassment if they affect the work environment; a second request for a date after a no has been given is a significant red flag; Blake should report; this is absolutely a work issue.

---

## CATEGORY 2: NON-SEXUAL HARASSMENT — EMPLOYEE LEVEL

### Scenario E-4: "The Accent"
> A coworker from the Philippines is frequently asked to repeat himself because some colleagues say they "can't understand" his accent. One colleague has started mimicking his accent to get laughs. When he mentions it bothers him, another coworker says "we're just joking around, you're too sensitive."

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What protected characteristic(s) are at issue here?
2. How does the "we're joking" response affect the analysis?
3. What would you do if you witnessed this?

**Key Teaching Points:** National origin and ancestry protected; "just a joke" is not a defense; repeated mockery can create hostile work environment; bystander responsibility to intervene.

---

### Scenario E-5: "The Pregnancy Comment"
> An employee announces she is pregnant. Her supervisor responds: "Oh wow, that's going to be interesting. We just gave you a big project. I hope you'll be around to finish it." In a later meeting, the supervisor says to the team that "we need to think about what happens if [employee name] isn't available."

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What's the problem with the supervisor's comments?
2. What protected characteristic is at issue?
3. What should the employee do?
4. What should the supervisor have said instead?

**Key Teaching Points:** Pregnancy is a protected characteristic; comments implying pregnancy = reduced reliability are discriminatory; supervisor has an obligation to address the legitimate project planning question privately, not publicly; this may also constitute disability or sex discrimination.

---

## CATEGORY 3: ABUSIVE CONDUCT / BULLYING

### Scenario E-6: "The Manager Who 'Demands Excellence'"
> A manager has a reputation for being "tough but fair." In team meetings, he often interrupts employees when presenting, calls their work "embarrassing" in front of the group, and has on at least two occasions told employees they "clearly aren't cut out for this." He says this is how he motivates the team. Some high performers have left. No one has filed a complaint.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Is this a management style or abusive conduct?
2. Does it matter that no one has complained?
3. What's the standard for "abusive conduct" under California law?
4. If you work on this team, what would you do?

**Key Teaching Points:** AB 2053 defines abusive conduct; "tough management" and abuse are distinguishable; the absence of complaints doesn't mean the absence of a problem; public humiliation is a hallmark of abusive conduct; high turnover is itself a warning sign.

## CATEGORY 4: SUPERVISOR-SPECIFIC SCENARIOS

### Scenario S-1: "The Star Employee"
> Your top-performing salesperson — responsible for 30% of team revenue — is the subject of an informal complaint. A junior employee mentioned to you that the salesperson has been making comments about her appearance and has invited her to "celebrate a big deal" one-on-one after hours. She said she didn't want to make a formal complaint because she "needs to work with him."

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What do you do, given that she said she doesn't want to file formally?
2. Does his performance affect your decision?
3. What are the risks if you don't report?

**Key Teaching Points:** Supervisors have a reporting duty independent of the victim's preference; performance is legally irrelevant to harassment; protecting a high performer at the expense of the investigation exposes the supervisor personally; HR determines how to proceed after the report.

---

### Scenario S-2: "The Returned Report"
> Three months after an investigation concluded (insufficient evidence), you notice that the accused employee — your subordinate — has been subtly excluding the complainant from meetings. The complainant hasn't said anything to you, but you've noticed it twice. You're not sure if it's intentional.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Do you need to act on what you've observed?
2. What would acting on it look like?
3. What's the risk of waiting for the complainant to report it?

**Key Teaching Points:** Post-investigation monitoring is a supervisor responsibility; retaliation often takes subtle forms; the supervisor should report the observed pattern to HR immediately without waiting for a formal complaint; proactive reporting is part of the duty.

---

### Scenario S-3: "The Complaint About You"
> An employee reports to HR that you — their supervisor — have been unfairly critical of her work since she reported a coworker's behavior two months ago. She says her performance reviews have worsened and you've been cold to her.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How does HR handle this complaint given that it's about you?
2. What happens to you during the investigation?
3. What should you have been doing differently over the past two months?

**Key Teaching Points:** Complaints about supervisors go to HR or above; the supervisor under investigation should cooperate fully; interim protective measures may include the supervisor being removed from direct oversight of the complainant; this is precisely why documentation matters — consistent performance feedback documented before and after a complaint protects the supervisor.

---

### Scenario S-4: "The Inappropriate Team Culture"
> You're newly promoted to manage a team that has a long-standing culture of crude jokes and casual touching (back-slapping, shoulder rubs) that "everyone" participates in and says they're fine with. Two veteran employees tell you "this is just how we are" when you raise a concern.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Does "everyone's fine with it" make it acceptable?
2. What is your obligation as the new supervisor?
3. How do you change the culture without alienating the team?

**Key Teaching Points:** Normalized behavior is not exempt from the law; the supervisor inherits the duty to address it regardless of how long it's existed; the fact that people participate doesn't mean they consented; a clear, direct conversation followed by consistent reinforcement is the approach — not a dramatic announcement.

---

## CATEGORY 5: BYSTANDER SCENARIOS

### Scenario B-1: "The Witness"
> You're in a team lunch and a coworker makes a clearly racist comment about another coworker's food. The target looks visibly uncomfortable but says nothing. The table goes awkward. Nobody says anything.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What should you do right now, in that moment?
2. What are the possible approaches?
3. What would you say?

*(Use this to practice the 4 D's directly.)*

---

### Scenario B-2: "The Confider"
> A colleague confides in you that their manager has been sending them late-night texts that feel "too personal" and they're not sure what to do. They ask you not to tell anyone because they're afraid of retaliation. They just want to talk about it.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How do you support this person?
2. Do you keep their confidence?
3. What if they insist you don't report?

**Key Teaching Points:** Non-supervisory employees are not required to report but can encourage reporting; you can share the reporting options and offer to accompany them; you can express your own concern; you cannot guarantee confidentiality if the situation escalates; this is different from a supervisor's mandatory reporting duty.
