## DETAILED FACILITATOR SCRIPT

### ⏱️ 0:00–0:05 — WELCOME & HOUSEKEEPING (5 min)

>
> Before we begin, a few housekeeping items: [For webinar: please keep your mics muted except when speaking; you can use the chat to submit questions at any time. We'll take questions throughout, not just at the end.] [For in-person: restrooms are located at ___. Please silence your phones.]
>

### ⏱️ 0:05–0:15 — MODULE 1: THE LAW & WHY IT MATTERS (10 min)

#### SLIDE: "Why Are We Here Today?"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "California has some of the strongest workplace harassment laws in the country. Two laws specifically require the training we're doing today:
>
> AB 1825, passed in 2005, originally required companies to train supervisors. Then in 2019, SB 1343 expanded that requirement to cover ALL employees — not just managers — at any company with 5 or more employees. That means this training applies to every single person in this room today.
>
> You must complete this training within 6 months of your hire date, and then every 2 years after that."

#### SLIDE: "This Matters Because..."

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Beyond legal compliance, here's the honest reason we do this: harassment causes real harm to real people. It damages careers, destroys trust, leads to serious psychological harm, and creates an environment where no one can do their best work.
>
> [COMPANY NAME]'s position is simple: zero tolerance. We take every report seriously. Our goal today is to make sure you know exactly what harassment looks like, what your rights are, and what to do if you experience or witness it."

💬 **DISCUSSION PROMPT:** "Before we define harassment — has anyone worked somewhere where the culture around this felt very different, either very positive or very problematic? You don't need to share details, just a quick sense."
*(Allow 2–3 responses. Keep this light — you're warming up the room.)*

---

### ⏱️ 0:15–0:30 — MODULE 2: WHAT IS HARASSMENT? (15 min)

#### SLIDE: "Two Types of Sexual Harassment"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "The law recognizes two forms of sexual harassment. The first is called quid pro quo — Latin for 'this for that.' This is when a supervisor implies or states that a job benefit — a promotion, a good shift, keeping your job — depends on accepting sexual advances. It's a power abuse. It's also one of the clearer-cut forms.
>
> The second form is hostile work environment. This is broader and more common. It means unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive enough that a reasonable person would find it hostile, intimidating, or abusive. Note that word 'or' — it can be one very severe incident, or it can be a pattern of less severe behavior that builds up over time."

#### SLIDE: "Protected Characteristics Under California Law"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Sexual harassment is just one type of prohibited harassment. Any harassment based on a protected characteristic is illegal. California law covers 15 protected characteristics — significantly broader than federal law. I'm going to go through them quickly."

**[FACILITATOR NOTE]:** Read the list — keep moving, don't dwell. The full list is in their handout. Pause on CROWN Act (hair/hairstyles) and gender identity as participants often don't know about these.

> "One important addition that's worth noting: in 2019, California passed the CROWN Act, which added hair texture and protective hairstyles — such as braids, locs, twists, and afros — to the list of protected characteristics under race. You cannot make comments about or discriminate based on someone's natural hair.
>
> And under gender identity: intentionally and repeatedly misgendering someone — using the wrong pronouns after being corrected — can constitute harassment."

#### SLIDE: "Scenario Discussion — What Would You Do?"

💬 **SCENARIO 1 (READ ALOUD):**
> "A coworker frequently sends funny memes to the group chat. Lately, some of them have sexual content. He says it's just humor. A few people laugh. But one employee finds them offensive and uncomfortable and has stopped participating in the chat.
>
> Question: Does this rise to the level of harassment? What would you do if you were the person who's uncomfortable?"

*(Allow discussion — 2–3 minutes. Guide toward: it doesn't require intent; the impact matters; the person should report it; you don't have to 'just take it.')*

💬 **SCENARIO 2 (READ ALOUD):**
> "A long-time employee makes a comment to a newer coworker from Mexico: 'Your English is really good for someone from there.' The coworker feels embarrassed and uncomfortable but isn't sure if it's a big deal.
>
> Question: Is this harassment? Does it need to happen repeatedly to be a problem?"

*(Guide toward: national origin / ancestry protected; microaggressions can create a hostile environment over time; single incidents can be reported even if they don't yet rise to harassment; better to report early.)*

---

### ⏱️ 0:30–0:40 — MODULE 3: YOUR RIGHTS & HOW TO REPORT (10 min)

#### SLIDE: "You Have Rights"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "If you experience or witness harassment, you have the right to report it — and you are protected by law from any retaliation for doing so. Let me say that plainly: if you report harassment in good faith and someone — a manager, a coworker, anyone — does anything negative to you because you reported, that retaliation is itself illegal and will be treated as a separate serious violation.
>
> You do not need proof to report. You do not need witnesses. You do not need to be certain. If something made you uncomfortable, report it and let HR assess it. That is what HR is here for."

#### SLIDE: "How to Report at [COMPANY NAME]"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "You have multiple reporting options, and you can use any of them:
>
> You can report to your immediate supervisor — unless that person is involved, in which case go directly to HR.
>
> You can report to HR directly: [HR NAME] at [EMAIL] or [PHONE].
>
> You can submit a written report — in person, by mail, or by email to [HR EMAIL].
>
> [If applicable:] You can use our anonymous reporting line at [PHONE/URL].
>
> Your report goes into a confidential investigation process. Information is shared only on a need-to-know basis."

#### SLIDE: "You Can Also Go Directly to the Government"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "You always have the option to file a complaint directly with a government agency — you don't have to use our internal process first.
>
> The California Civil Rights Department — formerly known as DFEH — handles state harassment complaints. You have 3 years from the most recent incident to file. Their phone number is 1-800-884-1684, and you can file online at calcivilrights.ca.gov.
>
> The federal EEOC handles federal charges and has a 300-day deadline. Filing with the CRD automatically cross-files with the EEOC, so you typically only need to file once."

💬 **DISCUSSION PROMPT:** "Is there anything that would make someone hesitant to report? What concerns might come up?"
*(This is an important trust-building moment. Common answers: fear of not being believed, fear of retaliation, not wanting to cause problems, embarrassment. Acknowledge each and respond to it directly.)*

---

### ⏱️ 0:40–0:50 — MODULE 4: BYSTANDER INTERVENTION (10 min)

#### SLIDE: "What If You See It Happening to Someone Else?"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Harassment rarely happens only when no one is watching. Most of the time, other people are present. You have a role to play, and you are protected when you play it.
>
> We use the 4 D's framework for bystander intervention:"

#### SLIDE: "The 4 D's"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "**Direct:** The most straightforward approach — say something in the moment. 'That's not appropriate.' 'Hey, that's not funny.' 'Stop.' This doesn't need to be aggressive. Just clear.
>
> **Distract:** You don't have to confront the situation directly. Create an interruption. Ask the harassed person a question about something unrelated. Spill something. Change the subject. Break the moment.
>
> **Delegate:** Get someone with authority involved. Get HR, get a supervisor. Say 'I need you to come with me right now.'
>
> **Delay:** If you couldn't do anything in the moment, check on the person afterward. 'I saw what happened — are you okay? That was not okay. Would you like help reporting it?'"

✏️ **ACTIVITY — Quick Poll (webinar: use polling tool; in-person: raise hands):**
> "Honestly — which of the 4 D's do you think you could most easily do in the moment? And which feels hardest?"

*(This generates conversation. Don't rush this — it's the most practical part of the training. 3–4 minutes of discussion is valuable.)*

---

### ⏱️ 0:50–0:58 — WRAP-UP & Q&A (8 min)

#### SLIDE: "Key Takeaways"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Let me leave you with the five things I want you to walk away with today:
>
> One — Harassment based on any protected characteristic is prohibited. Not just sexual harassment.
>
> Two — You don't need proof to report. Report in good faith and let HR investigate.
>
> Three — Retaliation for reporting is its own separate violation. You are protected.
>
> Four — You have external options — CRD and EEOC — if you choose not to use internal processes.
>
> Five — As a bystander, you have a role. Use the 4 D's.
>
> Any questions? And remember — there are no wrong questions."

**[FACILITATOR NOTE]:** Hold space for Q&A. If questions are slow to come, offer this prompt: "One thing I get asked often is [common question]. Here's how I answer that..." This often opens the floor. For webinar, monitor the chat actively.

**Common Q&As to Prepare For:**
- *"What if the person says they were just joking?"* — Intent doesn't determine harassment; impact does.
- *"What if I report and nothing happens?"* — Describe the investigation process; outcome isn't always visible to the reporter.
- *"Can I report something from a long time ago?"* — Yes, internally there's no deadline. CRD has 3 years.
- *"What if I'm being harassed by a customer?"* — Same policy applies. Report to your supervisor. We will address it.
- *"Is it harassment if it's online?"* — Yes, if it's work-related or between coworkers and impacts the work environment.
