## WHAT IS HARASSMENT?

### Sexual Harassment — Two Forms
**Quid Pro Quo:** A supervisor conditions a job benefit (promotion, scheduling, continued employment) on accepting sexual advances.

**Hostile Work Environment:** Unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is **severe OR pervasive** enough that a reasonable person would find the workplace hostile or abusive. A single severe incident can qualify. Intent doesn't matter — impact does.

### Non-Sexual Harassment
Harassment based on **any protected characteristic** is prohibited:

| Protected Class | Examples of Prohibited Conduct |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Race / Color | Racial slurs, racial jokes, racist comments |
| National Origin / Ancestry | Comments about accent, language, mockery of ethnicity |
| Religion | Religious slurs, mockery, unwanted proselytizing |
| Sex / Gender | Gendered insults, sexist comments, misgendering |
| Age (40+) | Ageist comments, "OK boomer," "too old" |
| Disability | Disability jokes, mimicking, references to limitations |
| Pregnancy | Comments about fertility, pregnancy plans, breastfeeding |
| Sexual Orientation | Anti-LGBTQ+ slurs, "outing" someone |
| Medical Condition | Cancer, HIV/AIDS, genetic comments |
| Hair / Hairstyle | Comments on natural hair or protective styles (CROWN Act) |

### Abusive Conduct (Workplace Bullying)
Malicious repeated mistreatment — verbal abuse, threats, humiliation, work sabotage — is also prohibited **even if not based on a protected characteristic**.
