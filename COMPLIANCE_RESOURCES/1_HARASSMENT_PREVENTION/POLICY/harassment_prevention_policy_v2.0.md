## 2. PROHIBITED CONDUCT

### A. Sexual Harassment — Two Forms

**Quid Pro Quo ("This for That"):**
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
- Submission is made a condition of employment
- Submission or rejection influences any employment decision (hiring, promotion, assignment, termination)
- The conduct unreasonably interferes with work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment

**Hostile Work Environment:**
Unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is severe **or** pervasive enough that a reasonable person would find it creates an intimidating, hostile, or abusive work environment.

> **Note:** A single severe incident (such as a sexual assault) can create a hostile work environment. Conduct need not be repeated.

### B. Examples of Sexual Harassment

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Verbal | Sexual comments about body/clothing; sexual jokes; repeated unwanted date requests; sexual rumors; whistling/catcalling; questions about sexual activity |

California law (AB 2053) requires training on abusive conduct, defined as:
> Conduct of an employer or employee in the workplace, with malice, that a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive, and unrelated to an employer's legitimate business interests.

Abusive conduct includes repeated verbal abuse, threats, intimidation, humiliation, work sabotage, or unreasonable work interference. **Abusive conduct is prohibited even when not based on a protected characteristic.**

## 6. INVESTIGATION PROCESS

### Prompt and Thorough Investigation:
All reports will be investigated promptly. Investigation begins within **[3] business days** and is completed within **[30] days** absent extraordinary circumstances.

### Investigation Steps:

1. **Initial Assessment** — HR reviews complaint, identifies interim protective measures, notifies appropriate parties
2. **Complainant Interview** — Detailed statement; documents, timeline, witnesses identified
3. **Respondent Interview** — Respondent notified of general nature of allegations and given opportunity to respond
4. **Witness Interviews** — All persons with relevant information interviewed
5. **Evidence Review** — Emails, texts, access logs, security footage, personnel records reviewed
6. **Analysis and Finding** — Credibility assessed; finding made: Substantiated / Unsubstantiated / Inconclusive
7. **Corrective Action** — If substantiated, appropriate discipline imposed

### Confidentiality:
Information is shared only on a need-to-know basis. Files are maintained separately from personnel records. Confidentiality cannot be absolute — some disclosure is required for a fair investigation.

### Interim Protective Measures:
During the investigation, [COMPANY NAME] may implement schedule changes, workspace relocation, paid administrative leave, or no-contact directives to protect all parties.

---

## 7. DISCIPLINE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

### If Harassment Is Substantiated:

| Severity | Potential Discipline |
|----------|---------------------|
| Minor / First offense | Written warning, mandatory retraining, performance improvement plan |
| Moderate / Repeated | Suspension without pay, demotion, transfer, final warning |
| Severe | Immediate termination; referral to law enforcement if criminal |

Factors considered: severity, frequency, prior history, the harasser's position and authority, impact on the victim and workplace, and evidence of remorse.

### If Complaint Is Unsubstantiated:
No discipline to the respondent. The investigation file is retained. Both parties are reminded of the policy. We will monitor the situation.

### If Complaint Is Made in Bad Faith:
A complaint that is knowingly false (not merely unproveable) may result in discipline. However, employees are never disciplined for reporting in good faith, even if the complaint cannot be substantiated.

---

## 8. ANTI-RETALIATION

**Retaliation is strictly prohibited.** [COMPANY NAME] will not retaliate — and will not tolerate retaliation by any employee — against any person who:
- Reports harassment in good faith
- Participates in a harassment investigation
- Exercises any right under this policy
- Files a complaint with CRD or EEOC
- Assists or encourages another person to report

**Retaliation includes:** demotion, reduction in hours or pay, undesirable reassignment, negative performance reviews, exclusion, hostility, or any adverse employment action related to protected activity.

**Retaliation is itself a violation of this policy and California law, even if the underlying harassment complaint was not substantiated.**

## 9. SUPERVISOR AND MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES

Supervisors and managers have enhanced obligations:

- Take all reports seriously and report to HR immediately (even if they think the complaint lacks merit)
- Do not investigate independently — route all reports to HR
- Implement interim protective measures when directed by HR
- Prevent retaliation within their teams
- Maintain confidentiality
- Document incidents as instructed by HR
- Attend all required training

### Personal Liability:
California law (Gov. Code § 12940(j)(3)) allows **personal liability** for supervisors who harass employees, know about harassment and fail to report it, retaliate against complainants, or discourage reporting. You may be sued **individually** even if the company is also named.

---

## 10. BYSTANDER INTERVENTION

If you witness harassment, you are encouraged to intervene using **the 4 D's**:

| Approach | What It Looks Like |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Direct** | "That's not appropriate." / "Stop." / "That comment is offensive." |
| **Distract** | Change the subject, ask someone a question, create an interruption |
| **Delegate** | Get a supervisor, HR, or another person with authority to intervene |
| **Delay** | Check on the victim afterward: "Are you okay? That was not okay." / Offer to be a witness |

**You are fully protected from retaliation for bystander intervention.**
