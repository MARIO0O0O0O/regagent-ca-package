## SECTION 5: REMOTE WORKERS AND MULTI-SITE EMPLOYERS

### Remote Employees

Employees who work remotely (full or partial) must still receive required notices. California does not have a regulatory safe harbor that fully exempts remote workers from posting requirements.

**Best practice for remote employees:**
- Maintain a **digital posting page** (intranet, HRIS portal, or shared drive) with PDF links to all required posters
- Send a direct notification to remote employees with the URL at hire and annually
- For the SB 294 Annual Notice: deliver via email with read receipt or e-signature acknowledgment
- Document delivery for every employee

**Physical posting still required** at any company location where employees report.

### Multi-Site Employers

Each location where employees report must have its own complete posting set. Centralized posting at headquarters does not satisfy obligations for satellite offices.

**[COMPANY NAME] locations requiring postings:**
- [LOCATION 1]: _______________
- [LOCATION 2]: _______________
- [LOCATION 3]: _______________
