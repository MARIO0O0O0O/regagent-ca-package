## At-a-Glance — Most Common Posting Violations

1. **Outdated minimum wage poster** — must be replaced every January when state rate increases
2. **Wrong IWC Wage Order** — each employer must post the Order for their specific industry
3. **Missing SB 294 notice** — new 2026 requirement; this is a *distributed notice*, not a wall poster
4. **No Spanish version** — required where Spanish-speaking employees are employed
5. **Remote employees not covered** — digital posting page + acknowledgment required
6. **Cal/OSHA 300A not posted** — must be posted February 1 through April 30 every year, including zero-incident years
7. **Outdated FMLA poster** — DOL releases updated versions; check annually at dol.gov/whd
8. **Workers' comp notice with wrong insurer** — must be updated within 10 days of carrier change
