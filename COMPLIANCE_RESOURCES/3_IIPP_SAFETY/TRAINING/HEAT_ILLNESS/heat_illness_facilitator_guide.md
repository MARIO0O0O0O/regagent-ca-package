# HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION TRAINING
## Facilitator Guide — Annual Required Training
### Cal/OSHA | 8 CCR § 3395

**Session Type:** Live — In-Person or Webinar  
**Duration:** 1 Hour  
**Audience:** All employees who work in outdoor environments OR indoor environments exceeding 80°F  
**Frequency:** Annually — complete **before** employees begin outdoor/heat-exposed work (ideally by April 1)  
**Trainer Requirements:** IIPP Program Administrator or designee trained in heat illness prevention  

**Legal Basis:**  
- 8 CCR § 3395 — Cal/OSHA Heat Illness Prevention Standard (amended 2015, 2024 updates)  
- Required since 2005; significantly strengthened with each revision  
- **New 2024 expansion:** Indoor heat illness prevention now required at 80°F threshold (expanded from outdoor-only)  
- Penalties: $15,625–$156,259 per violation; willful violations can exceed $156,000  

> **Training Trigger Reminder:** This training is required BEFORE an employee works in heat conditions — not at annual review time. If someone new joins mid-summer, train them before Day 1 in a hot environment.

## MODULE 1 — WHAT IS HEAT ILLNESS + WHY IT MATTERS IN CALIFORNIA
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[OPEN — Say exactly:]**

"Heat illness is a serious, life-threatening condition — and California has some of the highest rates of occupational heat illness in the country. Cal/OSHA has had a heat illness prevention standard since 2005, and it was significantly updated in 2024. Every year in California, workers die from heat illness that was preventable. We're here today so that doesn't happen to any of us."

---

**[COVER THE LAW — Say:]**

"California's heat illness prevention standard — 8 CCR § 3395 — applies to two main categories of work:

1. **Outdoor work** in any weather
2. **Indoor work** in any area where the temperature regularly reaches or exceeds **80°F** — this was expanded in 2024 and now covers warehouses, kitchens, laundries, factories, and other hot indoor spaces.

"If you work in heat — whether you're outside or in a hot building — this training applies to you."

---

**[CORE MESSAGE — Say:]**

"Heat illness is almost always preventable. The body regulates its own temperature through sweating and circulation. When heat overwhelms those systems — especially when combined with physical exertion — body temperature rises to dangerous levels. We prevent this through three things: **water, rest, and shade.** We'll come back to those in detail."

"The most important thing I want you to take away today: **if you feel symptoms of heat illness, stop working and report it immediately.** We'd rather lose a few minutes of productivity than lose you."

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"First let's understand what makes heat dangerous — because it's not just about how hot it is outside."

---

## MODULE 2 — RISK FACTORS
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"Heat illness doesn't just depend on temperature. It depends on a combination of factors — some environmental, some personal. Understanding these helps you recognize when conditions are dangerous."

---

**[ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS:]**

"These are the conditions around you:"

- **Temperature:** Higher air temperature = harder for the body to cool itself
- **Humidity:** The higher the humidity, the less effectively sweat evaporates — which is how we cool down. High humidity + high temperature = exponential danger
- **Direct sun exposure:** Can add 10–15°F to effective temperature
- **Physical labor:** Exertion generates body heat — a worker doing heavy labor generates 5–10× more heat than at rest
- **Lack of airflow:** Stagnant air prevents evaporative cooling
- **Radiant heat:** Heat radiating from pavement, machinery, or structures

"Cal/OSHA uses the concept of the **Heat Index** — which combines temperature and humidity into a 'feels like' temperature. A 90°F day at 80% humidity feels like 113°F to your body."

*[If possible, show a heat index chart on screen or printed reference]*

---

**[INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS:]**

"These vary person to person:"

- **New to the job or returning from absence** — bodies need time to acclimatize (we'll cover this)
- **New to a hot climate** — same issue
- **Low physical fitness or not used to physical labor**
- **Dehydration** — even mild dehydration significantly impairs heat tolerance
- **Certain medications** — diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, beta-blockers, and others can impair heat regulation *(employees don't need to disclose medications — just be aware this is a factor)*
- **Alcohol or caffeinated beverages** — dehydrating
- **Recent illness** — especially with fever, vomiting, or diarrhea
- **Heart or kidney conditions, diabetes**
- **Age** — older workers and very young workers have reduced heat tolerance
- **Obesity**
- **Previous heat illness** — significantly increases susceptibility

---

**[DISCUSSION PROMPT:]**

"Looking at those risk factors — which ones do you think are most relevant at our worksite, given the conditions here?"

*[Allow 1-2 responses. Validate good observations.]*

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Now let's cover what heat illness actually looks like — from early warning signs through life-threatening emergency."

---

## MODULE 3 — TYPES OF HEAT ILLNESS
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"Heat illness exists on a spectrum. The earlier you catch it, the easier it is to treat. The goal is to catch it before it becomes an emergency."

---

**[CONDITION 1: HEAT CRAMPS]**

"Heat cramps are painful muscle spasms — usually in the legs, abdomen, or arms. They're caused by fluid and salt loss from sweating."

**Signs:** Muscle spasms or pain during or after exertion in heat

**Response:**
- Rest in a cool area
- Drink water with electrolytes (sports drink or electrolyte packet — not just plain water if cramping)
- Do not return to heavy work for several hours
- Report to supervisor

"Heat cramps are the body's early warning. Don't ignore them."

---

**[CONDITION 2: HEAT SYNCOPE (Fainting)]**

"Heat syncope is fainting or near-fainting from standing in heat or rising quickly in hot conditions. It's caused by blood pooling in the extremities."

**Signs:** Sudden faintness, dizziness, brief loss of consciousness — usually when standing up

**Response:**
- Help the person to a cool area; have them lie down with feet elevated
- Give water if conscious
- Cool them down
- Seek medical attention if they don't recover quickly or if you're unsure

---

**[CONDITION 3: HEAT EXHAUSTION]**

"Heat exhaustion is a serious condition — the body's cooling system is under significant stress."

**Signs:**
- Heavy sweating
- Cool, pale, clammy skin
- Weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps
- Headache, nausea, dizziness
- Fast or weak pulse
- Possible vomiting

**Response:**
1. Move person to cool area immediately
2. Loosen or remove excess clothing
3. Apply cool, wet cloths to skin; fan them
4. Give cool water to sip if conscious and can swallow
5. **Call supervisor and Program Administrator immediately**
6. Seek medical evaluation — heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke rapidly

"With heat exhaustion, do not return the employee to work that day. They need to be evaluated medically."

---

**[CONDITION 4: HEAT STROKE — MEDICAL EMERGENCY]**

"Heat stroke is a **life-threatening emergency.** The body's temperature regulation has failed. Core body temperature is 104°F or higher."

**Signs:**
- High body temperature (103°F+)
- Skin is hot and either dry OR wet — but person may not be sweating appropriately
- Rapid, strong pulse
- **Confusion, slurred speech, altered mental state, loss of consciousness** — this is the key distinguishing sign
- May not complain of thirst
- Can progress to seizure, organ failure, death

**Response:**
1. **Call 911 immediately**
2. Move person to cool area
3. Cool them aggressively: ice packs to neck, armpits, groin; cool wet towels; fan
4. Do not give fluids to someone who is confused or unconscious
5. Stay with person until emergency services arrive
6. Notify supervisor and management immediately

> **Critical distinction:** With heat stroke, the person may NOT feel hot to themselves — they may feel fine just before collapsing. **Confusion is the warning sign. Take it seriously every time.**

---

**[SCENARIO DISCUSSION:]**

"Let's run through a quick scenario. You and a coworker are working outdoors. It's 95°F. Your coworker has been quiet for a while, and when you ask if they're okay, they seem confused and give you a slow, unclear answer. What do you do?"

*[Allow response. Correct answer: Call 911 immediately — this is heat stroke until proven otherwise. Do not wait and see.]*

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Now — and this is the most important module — how do we prevent heat illness from happening in the first place."

---

## MODULE 4 — PREVENTION: WATER, REST, SHADE, AND ACCLIMATIZATION
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"Cal/OSHA requires us to have specific preventive measures in place. These aren't suggestions — they're legal requirements. And they work."

---

**[ELEMENT 1: WATER]**

"The standard is: **one quart of cool water per hour** for employees working in the heat. That's approximately four 8-oz cups per hour — more than most people drink."

Key points:
- Water must be provided by the employer — it's not the employee's responsibility to bring their own
- Water must be cool (not hot) and accessible without significant delay
- Water must be in sufficient quantity — don't wait until it runs out
- **Drink before you're thirsty.** By the time you feel thirst, you're already mildly dehydrated.
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine on workdays — they dehydrate you

"Where is water available at our worksite? [DESCRIBE SPECIFIC LOCATION/PROCEDURE]"

---

**[ELEMENT 2: SHADE]**

"Employees must have access to shade whenever they request it — no questions asked. Shade must be available at the worksite, not a five-minute walk away."

Cal/OSHA shade requirements:
- Shade for **at least 25% of the number of employees on shift** at any given time
- Must be outside of direct sun exposure
- Must be large enough to accommodate employees who want to use it during rest periods
- Temperature in shade must be below 80°F

"Our shade provisions at this worksite: [DESCRIBE — e.g., canopy location, shaded break area, indoor break room]"

"If shade is not available and you need it, stop work and notify your supervisor. Providing shade is our obligation, not yours to work around."

---

**[ELEMENT 3: REST / COOL-DOWN PERIODS]**

"Employees showing signs of heat illness or who feel overheated must be allowed to take a cool-down rest."

Requirements:
- Rest in shade for at least **5 minutes** when needed
- Employee may **not** be ordered back to work while experiencing heat illness symptoms
- Supervisor must monitor employee during cool-down
- If symptoms don't improve within 5–10 minutes, treat as heat exhaustion

"**High-heat procedures:** When the temperature reaches or is expected to reach **95°F**, we activate additional measures. These include:" *(See Module 5)*

---

**[ELEMENT 4: ACCLIMATIZATION — THE MOST OVERLOOKED RISK]**

"Acclimatization is the process by which the body adapts to working in heat. It takes approximately **7 to 14 days** of gradual exposure."

"**The most dangerous time for a worker is their first five days in a hot environment.** This is true even for physically fit people. The body simply hasn't adapted yet."

Acclimatization schedule example:
| Day | Maximum Time in Full Heat |
|-----|--------------------------|
| 1-2 | 20% of shift |
| 3-4 | 40% of shift |
| 5-7 | 60% of shift |
| 8-10 | 80% of shift |
| 11+ | Full shift |

"This applies to:
- New employees starting outdoor or hot work
- Employees returning from 7+ days off
- Employees new to our climate
- Anyone being assigned to unusually hot conditions"

"Supervisors: it is your responsibility to pace new or returning employees. It is not the employee's job to push through it."

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Let's talk about our specific procedures."

---

## MODULE 5 — OUR HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION PROCEDURES
*[5 minutes]*

---

**[Cover company-specific procedures — fill in before each session:]**

**Our water supply:**
"[DESCRIBE — e.g., Coolers stocked at each station before shifts begin; water station at the south break area; refilled by [NAME] by 7am daily]"

**Our shade:**
"[DESCRIBE — e.g., Canopy in loading area; break room is always available; shaded tables on north side of building]"

**High-heat protocol (95°F and above):**
When the forecast or actual temperature reaches 95°F:
- Supervisors check on workers more frequently — minimum every [TIME INTERVAL]
- Pre-shift reminder about drinking water and recognizing symptoms
- Buddy system — no one works alone in the hottest areas
- [ADDITIONAL COMPANY-SPECIFIC MEASURES]

**Emergency contact:**
"If someone shows signs of heat illness:
- Call 911 for suspected heat stroke
- Call [SUPERVISOR NAME/PHONE] for heat exhaustion or cramps
- First aid kit is at [LOCATION]
- We record every heat illness incident — even minor ones"

---

## MODULE 6 — Q&A + SIGN-IN
*[5 minutes]*

---

**[OPEN Q&A — Say:]**

"Any questions? About the procedures, the symptoms, or anything from today?"

**Prepared answers:**

**"What if my supervisor tells me I can't take a shade break?"**  
"That would violate California law. You have the legal right to cool-down breaks whenever you feel overheated. If that happens, report it to me or to Cal/OSHA. Your job is protected."

**"I've been working in heat for years — do I really need to worry about this?"**  
"Yes, absolutely. Heat illness can happen to experienced workers. Prior heat illness actually increases susceptibility. The acclimatization window applies every season."

**"What if I'm already really thirsty — is it too late?"**  
"Mild thirst means mild dehydration — drink now and keep drinking. If you're extremely thirsty, have a headache, or feel dizzy, stop and rest. That's early heat exhaustion."

**"Can I be disciplined for stopping to rest?"**  
"No. Cal/OSHA prohibits discipline for using heat illness prevention measures. If that ever happens, let me know immediately."

---

**[CLOSE — Say:]**

"Remember the three words: **water, rest, shade.** Watch out for your coworkers as well as yourself. And if anything feels off — stop and report it. No job task is worth a trip to the hospital."
