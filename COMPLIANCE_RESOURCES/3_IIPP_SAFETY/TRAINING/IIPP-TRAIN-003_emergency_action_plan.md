## SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:03 — WELCOME

[READ ALOUD]
"This training covers our Emergency Action Plan. The goal is simple: when an emergency happens, you don't have time to figure out what to do. We're going to make sure that if an alarm goes off tomorrow, you know exactly where to go, what to do, and who to report to. This is a 20-minute session."

### 0:03-0:08 — ALARMS, ROUTES, AND ASSEMBLY

[SHOW EVACUATION MAP]
[READ ALOUD]
"Our emergency alarm is: [DESCRIBE — horn, bell, PA announcement, strobe]. When you hear or see it, the default action is always evacuate unless a shelter-in-place is specifically announced.

The nearest exit from [THIS AREA / YOUR WORKSTATION] is: [POINT OUT ON MAP].
The secondary exit is: [POINT OUT].
Do NOT use the elevator during fire evacuations.

Our assembly point is: [SPECIFIC LOCATION — be precise: 'the parking lot on the north side of the building at the far end, away from the entrance'].

Once at the assembly point: find [EVACUATION COORDINATOR NAME]. They will account for every person. Do not leave until you have been checked in. Do not attempt to re-enter the building for any reason until emergency responders give the all-clear.

Our evacuation coordinator for [YOUR AREA] is: [NAME]. If they are not present, the backup is: [NAME]."

### 0:08-0:15 — SCENARIO WALK-THROUGH

[READ ALOUD]
"Let me walk through three specific scenarios.

FIRE: Alarm sounds or you see smoke or flames. Stop work. Leave your belongings — do not go back for a bag or phone. Take the nearest exit. If you must pass through a door, feel the door handle first. Hot handle means do not open — use another route. Close doors behind you to slow fire spread. Proceed to assembly point. Account for yourself with the coordinator.

SHELTER IN PLACE: You will receive a specific instruction over the PA or from a supervisor. This is used for outdoor hazardous material releases or active threat situations where leaving the building is more dangerous than staying. Go to the designated shelter-in-place room: [LOCATION]. Seal gaps under the door if possible. Stay until official all-clear.

ACTIVE THREAT (covered in detail in our Workplace Violence Prevention Training): Run if you can get out safely. Hide if you can't — lock or barricade the door. Fight only as an absolute last resort. Call 911 when you are safe."

### 0:15-0:18 — SPECIAL SITUATIONS

[READ ALOUD]
"Two situations to address specifically:

Visitors and contractors: If you have a visitor with you when an emergency occurs, you are responsible for guiding them to the exit. Do not assume they know the building.

Employees who need assistance: If you have a mobility impairment or other disability that would affect your ability to evacuate independently, please speak with HR confidentially so we can create a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan for you. Our evacuation coordinators are identified to assist employees who need help."

### 0:18-0:20 — Q&A AND SIGN-IN

[READ ALOUD]
"Any questions about evacuation routes, the assembly point, or your coordinator? Please sign the roster."
