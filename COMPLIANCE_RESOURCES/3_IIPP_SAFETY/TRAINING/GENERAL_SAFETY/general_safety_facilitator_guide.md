## MODULE 1 — WHY SAFETY MATTERS + OUR IIPP
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[OPEN — Say exactly:]**

"Welcome to [Company Name]. Before you start working, we're going to cover the safety basics that protect you and everyone around you. This isn't a formality — it's required by California law, and more importantly, it's information that could prevent you from getting hurt."

"California requires every employer to have a written Injury and Illness Prevention Program — or IIPP. We have one. You can see a copy at any time by asking [NAME / asking HR / at this location]. Today I'm going to walk you through the key elements."

---

**[KEY POINTS — Cover each:]**

**Our program administrator is [NAME].**
- "If you ever have a safety concern, a question, or witness something unsafe — this is one person you can go to. Contact info is on your handout."

**Safety is a condition of employment.**
- "We expect everyone to follow safe work practices. There are consequences for not doing so — but we also recognize and reward people who make safety a priority."

**You will never be retaliated against for reporting a safety concern.**
- "If you see something unsafe, we want to know. You can tell your supervisor, you can tell [NAME], or if you're uncomfortable doing either, you can contact Cal/OSHA directly. The number is on your handout. No one can punish you for reporting."

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Now let's talk about the specific hazards in your work environment."

---

## MODULE 2 — HAZARD RECOGNITION
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"A hazard is any condition or action that could cause injury, illness, or property damage. Recognizing hazards is a skill — and one of the most important things you can do to stay safe."

---

**[COVER THE FOUR HAZARD CATEGORIES:]**

**Category 1: Physical Hazards**
*[Adapt examples to your actual workplace — fill in before session]*

"Physical hazards are the things you can see or touch that could hurt you. At our workplace, these include:"

- **[HAZARD SPECIFIC TO YOUR SITE]** — e.g., "Wet floors near the breakroom — always look for wet floor signs."
- **[HAZARD SPECIFIC TO YOUR SITE]** — e.g., "Stock shelving — never climb shelves, use the ladder."
- **[HAZARD SPECIFIC TO YOUR SITE]** — e.g., "Loading dock — stay behind the yellow line unless you're assigned dock work."
- Slips, trips, and falls: "Keep your walkways clear. Report spills immediately."
- Electrical: "Never use equipment with damaged cords. Tag it out and report it."

---

**Category 2: Ergonomic Hazards**

"Ergonomic hazards come from how we move our bodies — especially repeated motions or awkward positions."

- Lifting: "Lift with your legs, not your back. Ask for help or use equipment for anything over [WEIGHT LIMIT — common is 25-50 lbs depending on task]."
- Repetitive motion: "If you feel strain or pain that keeps coming back, report it early. We can adjust your workstation or workflow."
- Workstation setup: "For office workers — your monitor should be at eye level, chair at 90 degrees. If something doesn't feel right, tell your supervisor."

---

**Category 3: Chemical / Hazardous Materials Hazards**
*(Skip if no chemical exposure at this worksite)*

"If your job involves any chemicals — cleaning supplies, solvents, industrial materials — you have the right to know what you're working with."

- "Our Safety Data Sheets — SDS — are kept at [LOCATION]. You can read them any time."
- "Before you use any chemical, know what it is, what precautions to take, and what to do if you're exposed."
- "Never mix chemicals unless you've been specifically trained to do so."
- PPE: "If there's a PPE requirement for a task, it's not optional. If you don't have the right PPE, stop and ask."

---

**Category 4: Environmental Hazards**

"These are conditions in the environment itself."

- **Heat:** "If your work area is hot — indoors or outdoors — we have heat illness prevention procedures. We'll cover those separately if your role involves heat exposure." *(Reference Heat Illness training if applicable)*
- **Noise:** "If you need to raise your voice to be heard at normal conversation distance from a co-worker, that environment may require hearing protection."
- **[OTHER SITE-SPECIFIC:]** e.g., air quality, confined spaces, heights

---

**[DISCUSSION PROMPT — Ask:]**

"Based on what you've seen so far today — what's one hazard you noticed in your work area that you want to ask about?"

*[Allow 2-3 responses. Answer or commit to following up. This shows reports are taken seriously from Day 1.]*

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Now we're going to cover what to do in an emergency. This is the part you especially want to know before you need it."

---

## MODULE 3 — EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"Emergencies are rare — but they happen. And the decisions you make in the first two minutes matter. We're going to cover our three core emergency scenarios."

---

**[SECTION 3A: MEDICAL EMERGENCY]**

"If someone is injured or becomes ill at work:"

1. **"Call 911 immediately if the situation is serious."** — Don't hesitate, don't look for a manager first.
2. **"Provide first aid if you're trained."** — Our first aid kits are located at [LOCATION(S)]. If you're AED-certified, the AED is at [LOCATION].
3. **"Stay with the person until help arrives."**
4. **"Do not move an injured person unless they're in immediate danger."**
5. **"Report to [NAME / Program Administrator] immediately after."**

"The nearest hospital is [NAME] at [ADDRESS]. Phone: [PHONE]."  
"Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222."

---

**[SECTION 3B: FIRE / EVACUATION]**

"If you discover a fire or hear the fire alarm:"

1. **"Activate the alarm."** — Pull station at [LOCATION].
2. **"Call 911."**
3. **"Evacuate immediately."** — Do not use elevators. Use stairs.
4. **"Know your exit."** — *[POINT TO OR DISPLAY EVACUATION MAP]* "Your primary exit is [DIRECTION]. Secondary exit is [DIRECTION]."
5. **"Assembly point: [LOCATION]."** — "We take attendance there. Do not leave the building and go home — we need to account for everyone."
6. **"If you encounter smoke, stay low."**
7. **"Never go back in for belongings."**

"Fire extinguishers: [LOCATIONS]. Use only on small, contained fires — if it's growing, get out."

*[If conducting in-person: Walk employees through the exit route and point out assembly point.]*

---

**[SECTION 3C: ACTIVE THREAT / EVACUATION ORDER]**

"In the unlikely event of an active threat or police-ordered evacuation:"

- **Run** if you can safely get out — leave everything, help others who can move, call 911 when safe.
- **Hide** if you can't run — lock/barricade the door, silence your phone, turn off lights, stay away from doors and windows.
- **Fight** only as an absolute last resort — use anything available, act aggressively, commit fully.

"Management will communicate via [COMMUNICATION METHOD — e.g., text alert system, overhead announcement]. Make sure your emergency contact information is on file with HR."

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Next we're going to talk about your rights — because California gives you some of the strongest safety protections of any state in the country."

---

## MODULE 4 — YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW TO REPORT
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"You have legal rights when it comes to workplace safety. I'm going to go through the most important ones."

---

**[RIGHT 1: Right to Know]**

"Under California's Hazard Communication standard, you have the right to know about any hazardous chemicals you may be exposed to. SDS are available at [LOCATION]. You can ask to see them at any time."

---

**[RIGHT 2: Right to Refuse Unsafe Work]**

"California law gives you the right to refuse work you reasonably believe poses an imminent danger of death or serious injury — **if** you've brought it to your employer's attention and we haven't corrected it. You will not be fired or disciplined for exercising this right in good faith."

"If you face a situation you're unsure about, come talk to me or [supervisor name] before walking off the job. Almost always, there's a solution."

---

**[RIGHT 3: Right to Report Without Retaliation]**

"You can report safety violations, injuries, or concerns to:
- Your supervisor
- Me (the Program Administrator) — [CONTACT INFO]
- Cal/OSHA — 1-800-963-9424 (you can do this anonymously)

No one at this company will retaliate against you for making a good-faith safety report. If you believe you've been retaliated against, you can file a complaint with the California Labor Commissioner."

---

**[RIGHT 4: Right to See Records — SB 513, effective Jan. 1, 2026]**

"Starting this year, your training records are considered part of your personnel file. You have the right to request a copy. Just ask HR."

---

**[REPORTING INJURIES]**

"If you're injured at work — even a small cut, strain, or near-miss — report it immediately. Don't wait until it gets worse. Don't worry about workers' comp rates or paperwork. Your health is the priority."

"How to report:
- Tell your supervisor right away
- Complete IIPP-FORM-004 with your supervisor's help
- You'll be directed to [CLINIC NAME / PHYSICIAN NETWORK / process for workers' comp]"

"Early reporting protects you legally. Delayed reporting can complicate your workers' comp claim."

---

**[TRANSITION:]**
"Let's do questions before we wrap up."

---

## MODULE 5 — Q&A AND SIGN-IN
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[OPEN Q&A — Say:]**

"We have about 8 minutes for questions. What's on your mind? No question is too small — if you're wondering, it's worth asking."

---

**[PREPARED ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS:]**

**"What if my supervisor tells me not to report an injury?"**  
"That would violate California law. You have the absolute right to report a work-related injury. If that happens, come to me directly, or contact Cal/OSHA. Your job is protected."

**"What if I get hurt but I don't think it's serious?"**  
"Report it anyway, the same day. A small strain can become a serious injury. Delayed reporting also creates problems if you ever need workers' comp."

**"What if I'm on a deadline and there's no time to fix a hazard?"**  
"A deadline never justifies unsafe work. Flag it, and we'll either fix it fast or figure out a workaround together. That's my job."

**"I'm new — will people think I'm complaining if I bring up hazards?"**  
"No. We actively want new eyes on our workplace. You may see things we've stopped noticing. Bring them to me."

**"What happens after I report a hazard?"**  
"I document it, assess the risk level, and implement a correction — within 24 hours for serious hazards, within 7 days for moderate ones. I'll close the loop with you on what was done."

---

**[CLOSE — Say:]**

"That covers the core of what you need to know before starting work here. A few things to remember:"

1. "If something looks unsafe, say something — to your supervisor or to me."
2. "If you're injured, report it that day."
3. "You're protected by law when you report. We back that up with our own policy."
4. "Your handout has all the key contacts and procedures. Keep it."

"We're glad you're here. Let's keep each other safe."

---

**[SIGN-IN — 2 minutes]**

"Before you go — please sign in on the roster. This creates your training record, which is required by law. Your signature confirms that you received this orientation."

*[Pass IIPP-FORM-006 or collect digital completion confirmation]*

---

## POST-TRAINING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Collect all signed IIPP-FORM-006 rosters
- [ ] File training records in personnel files (SB 513 compliance — training records = personnel records)
- [ ] Enter training completion in training log
- [ ] Note any follow-up items raised during Q&A — and actually follow up
- [ ] Confirm employee's supervisor knows orientation is complete

---

## FACILITATOR NOTES

**If conducting via webinar:**
- Display evacuation map and emergency contacts as screen share
- Use chat for questions throughout — don't hold all to the end
- Send participant handout PDF in advance or post in calendar invite
- Use digital sign-in via IIPP-FORM-006 (fillable PDF or form link)

**For large new-hire cohorts:**
- Module 3 (Emergency Procedures) should include a physical walk-through of exit routes if at all possible — even a 5-minute building walk adds significant retention
- Consider site-specific photo slides for Module 2 (actual hazards at this worksite)

**Language access:**
- If employee's primary language is not English, conduct training in their language or provide a qualified interpreter
- Training in a language the employee does not understand does not satisfy the legal requirement
