## SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:03 — WELCOME

[READ ALOUD]
"Welcome. Today's session covers our Injury and Illness Prevention Program — the IIPP — which California law requires every employer to have and every employee to be trained on. This is a 30-minute session. I want you to leave knowing exactly what to do if there's an emergency, how to report a safety problem, and what your rights are.

Let's get into it."

### 0:03-0:10 — WHAT IS THE IIPP?

[READ ALOUD]
"The IIPP is [COMPANY NAME]'s master safety plan. Cal/OSHA, which is California's workplace safety agency, requires every employer to have a written program that covers how we identify hazards, train employees, investigate accidents, and correct problems.

Our IIPP covers everything from emergency evacuation to how you report a hazard to how we handle a workplace injury. A copy is available to you at any time — just ask HR or your supervisor.

The most important thing to know: safety is everyone's job. Management's job is to identify hazards, provide training, and fix problems. Your job is to follow the safety rules, use the equipment you're given, and — critically — to report any unsafe condition you see. You don't have to fix it yourself. You just have to tell someone."

DISCUSSION: "Before I go further — does anyone know where the nearest fire extinguisher is? Emergency exit? First aid kit?" [Walk through if they don't know. This is the first practical check.]

### 0:10-0:18 — YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

[READ ALOUD]
"Under California law and our IIPP, you have the following rights:

You have the right to a safe workplace. That is a legal guarantee, not a policy option.

You have the right to know about any hazardous chemicals or materials you work with. We maintain Safety Data Sheets — SDS — for every chemical in this workplace. They're located at [LOCATION]. If you want to know what something is, ask.

You have the right to report a safety concern to Cal/OSHA directly — confidentially — without going through [COMPANY NAME] first. The number is 1-800-963-9424.

And most importantly: you have the right to report safety concerns without retaliation. Period. If you report a hazard or a workplace injury and someone takes a negative action against you because of it, that is illegal. Come to HR immediately.

Your responsibilities are straightforward: follow the rules, use your PPE, report hazards, report injuries — no matter how minor — and participate in training. If you see something unsafe, say something. That simple act has prevented thousands of workplace injuries."

### 0:18-0:27 — EMERGENCY PROCEDURES WALK-THROUGH

[READ ALOUD]
"Now let's walk through what to do in an emergency. I want this to be concrete and specific to our location — not abstract."

FIRE:
"If you hear a fire alarm or see or smell smoke: stop what you're doing immediately. Do not grab your belongings. Leave by the nearest exit — [POINT OUT / SHOW MAP]. Do not use the elevator. Meet at our assembly point: [LOCATION]. When you get there, find [EMERGENCY COORDINATOR NAME] — they will account for everyone. Do not go back in the building until the all-clear is given."

MEDICAL EMERGENCY:
"If someone collapses, is injured, or is having a medical emergency: call 911 first. Then notify your supervisor. Our nearest AED is at [LOCATION] and our first aid kit is at [LOCATION]. Employees who are first aid certified: [NAMES]. Do not move an injured person unless they are in immediate danger of further injury."

EARTHQUAKE:
"Drop, Cover, Hold On. Get under a sturdy desk or against an interior wall, away from windows and shelving. Cover your head and neck. Hold on until the shaking stops — this usually feels much longer than it is. Then evacuate when safe, watching for falling debris. Proceed to the assembly point."

CHEMICAL SPILL:
"Alert coworkers in the area. If you can safely do so, contain the spill with the materials at [LOCATION]. If there is any doubt about your safety — evacuate the area. Consult the SDS for the chemical. If any exposure has occurred, call 911 and notify your supervisor immediately."

DISCUSSION: "Any questions about these procedures? Any part of the emergency plan that doesn't feel clear for your specific work area?"

### 0:27-0:30 — Q&A AND SIGN-IN

[READ ALOUD]
"Three quick reminders before we close:

One — you can report any unsafe condition to your supervisor, to HR, or directly to Cal/OSHA at 1-800-963-9424.

Two — every injury and near-miss must be reported the same day it happens. Even if it seems minor. Even if you're not sure if it counts.

Three — this training repeats every year. Safety knowledge goes stale. We'll see you next year.

Please sign the roster and complete the acknowledgment form before you leave."
