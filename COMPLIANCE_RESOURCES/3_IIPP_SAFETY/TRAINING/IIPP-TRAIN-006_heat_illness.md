## IMPORTANT: CALIFORNIA HEAT ILLNESS STANDARD IS STRICT

Cal/OSHA's Heat Illness Prevention standard (8 CCR 3395) is one of the most robustly enforced workplace safety regulations in California. It applies to ALL outdoor work when temperatures equal or exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and has specific requirements for high-heat conditions (95 degrees and above). Violations carry significant fines and enforcement history is strong.

## SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:04 — WELCOME

[READ ALOUD]
"Today's training is on heat illness prevention. This is not optional and it is not a formality — heat illness kills workers in California every year, and most of those deaths were preventable. Cal/OSHA takes this standard seriously and so do we.

This training is required before you begin any outdoor work this season and every year before the season starts. Let's make sure you leave today knowing how to protect yourself and your coworkers."

### 0:04-0:12 — TYPES OF HEAT ILLNESS

[READ ALOUD]
"There are three levels of heat illness, and understanding the progression can save a life.

Heat Cramps — the earliest stage. Painful muscle cramps or spasms, usually in the legs or abdomen. Caused by salt and fluid loss from sweating. Response: move to a cool area, drink water or a sports drink with electrolytes, rest. Do not return to work until cramps fully resolve.

Heat Exhaustion — more serious. Symptoms include: heavy sweating, cool and pale or flushed skin, fast and weak pulse, nausea or vomiting, weakness, dizziness, headache, fainting. Response: move person to a cool area, loosen clothing, apply cool wet cloths, have them sip water. Call 911 if symptoms are severe or vomiting prevents fluid intake.

Heat Stroke — a medical emergency. Symptoms include: high body temperature (103 degrees or higher), hot and red skin (may be dry or damp), rapid and strong pulse, confusion, loss of consciousness. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent brain damage. Call 911 immediately. Cool the person rapidly using any available method — ice packs to neck, armpits, groin; cool water immersion; cool wet sheets. Do not give fluids to someone who is unconscious or confused."

DISCUSSION: "Has anyone witnessed or experienced heat exhaustion on the job? What did it look and feel like?"

### 0:12-0:20 — PREVENTION: WATER, REST, SHADE

[READ ALOUD]
"Cal/OSHA requires three things: water, rest, and shade. Let me be specific about each.

WATER: Employees must have access to cool, potable water at all times. The requirement is one quart per hour for moderate-to-heavy work in heat. That is more than most people drink. Drink proactively — do not wait until you are thirsty. Thirst is already a sign of mild dehydration.

REST: Employees must have access to rest periods in a cool location. Use your breaks. Do not skip them. If you feel early symptoms of heat illness, stop work and move to the shade or a cool area immediately. You will not get in trouble for doing this.

SHADE: Adequate shade must be available for all employees. The shade must be open to the air — a hot, enclosed space does not qualify. Shade structures must accommodate the number of employees on rest at any given time.

ACCLIMATIZATION: This is the most important and most overlooked factor. Your body needs time to adjust to working in heat. In California, employers must closely observe all employees during the first 14 days of work in the heat — and especially during the first few days of a heat wave. New employees and employees returning from extended absence are at highest risk. Do not rush acclimatization."

### 0:20-0:27 — HIGH-HEAT PROCEDURES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

[READ ALOUD]
"When the temperature equals or exceeds 95 degrees Fahrenheit, additional requirements apply:

Employees must be observed for symptoms at least every hour — not just if someone reports feeling ill.

Supervisors must maintain effective communication with employees throughout the work period — radio, phone, or direct visual contact.

A pre-shift reminder about the symptoms of heat illness and the importance of drinking water must be given each day temperatures reach 95 or above.

Buddy system — if employees are working in remote locations or isolated areas, they must work with a partner.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE — if a coworker shows signs of heat stroke:
1. Call 911 immediately.
2. Move the person to the coolest available location.
3. Cool them aggressively — ice packs to neck, armpits, and groin; cool wet cloths; fan them. Every minute matters.
4. Contact [SUPERVISOR / EMERGENCY COORDINATOR] at [PHONE].
5. Stay with the person until EMS arrives.

Do not hesitate to call 911. You will never be disciplined for calling emergency services for a coworker."

### 0:27-0:30 — Q&A AND SIGN-IN

[READ ALOUD]
"Summary: Three things protect you — water, rest, shade. Watch for symptoms in yourself and your coworkers. If you see signs of heat stroke, call 911 immediately. Report any heat illness symptoms to your supervisor the same day.

Questions? Please sign the roster."
