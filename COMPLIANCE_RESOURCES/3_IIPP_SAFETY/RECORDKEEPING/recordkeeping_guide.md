> **SB 513 (Effective January 1, 2026):** Training records — including IIPP-FORM-006 rosters — are now legally considered **personnel records** under Labor Code § 1198.5. They must be:
> - Filed in or linked to the employee's personnel file
> - Produced within 30 days of a request by the employee or their representative
> - Retained as long as other personnel records (at minimum, duration of employment + 3 years)
>
> Practical impact: Use 5-year retention for all safety training records to satisfy both the IIPP and SB 513 requirements simultaneously.

## CAL/OSHA 300 LOG — WHAT IT IS AND WHO MUST MAINTAIN IT

### Who Must Keep the 300 Log

Employers with **11 or more employees** in most industries must keep the Cal/OSHA 300 Log. Some industries are partially exempt — check with Cal/OSHA if unsure. All employers must report serious injuries/fatalities regardless of size.

### Three Required Forms

| Form | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Cal/OSHA 300** | Running log of all recordable work-related injuries and illnesses during the year |
| **Cal/OSHA 301** | Individual incident report for each entry on the 300 Log |
| **Cal/OSHA 300A** | Annual summary — posted February 1 through April 30 each year |

### What Is Recordable

A work-related injury or illness is recordable if it results in:
- Death
- Days away from work
- Restricted work or job transfer
- Medical treatment beyond first aid
- Loss of consciousness
- Significant diagnosis by a healthcare professional (e.g., hearing loss, needle stick, tuberculosis)

**Not recordable (first aid only):** Bandages, OTC medication at nonprescription strength, non-rigid means of support, temporary immobilization, removal of splinters/foreign bodies from skin/eye, drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.

### Annual Posting Requirement

The **Cal/OSHA 300A Summary** must be:
- Signed by a company executive (owner, officer, or highest-ranking manager at the establishment)
- Posted in a visible location at the workplace **from February 1 through April 30** every year
- Posted even if there were **zero** recordable incidents (a zero summary still must be signed and posted)

### Employee Access to 300 Log

Current and former employees (and their representatives) may request a copy of the 300 Log at any time. Provide within **7 days** of the request. You may withhold the employee's name if they were involved in a sensitive case (e.g., sexual assault, mental illness), but not other information.

## CAL/OSHA SERIOUS INJURY REPORTING

**Any of the following must be reported to Cal/OSHA within 8 hours:**
- Work-related **fatality**
- **Inpatient hospitalization** of one or more employees for more than 24 hours (not for observation)
- **Amputation** of any body part
- **Loss of an eye**

**How to report:**  
Call Cal/OSHA 24-hour hotline: **1-800-963-9424**  
Or contact your local Cal/OSHA district office: **[DISTRICT OFFICE PHONE]**

**What to report:** Employer name, location, time of incident, nature of injury, number of employees affected, contact person and phone.

**Do not:**
- Alter the scene before Cal/OSHA inspection (except to prevent further injury)
- Fail to report to avoid scrutiny — the penalty for non-reporting is severe
