## Key Compliance Points — 2026

**Daily overtime** is California's most-misunderstood rule — overtime triggers at 8 hours per day, not just 40 hours per week. Federal FLSA's weekly-only rule does not apply in California.

**Meal period before hour 5** — not "sometime during the shift." The first meal period must begin before the end of the 5th hour of work.

**Regular rate recalculation** — overtime is calculated on total compensation including non-discretionary bonuses, not base rate alone.

**Exempt threshold rises every January** — always recalculate $16.90 × 2 × 2,080. Every salaried-exempt employee must earn at least the new threshold or loses exempt status.

**PAGA exposure is systemic** — one employee's wage and hour violation is a signal that others experienced the same thing. Class-wide PAGA exposure is why audit and prevention matter so much.

**Vacation/PTO is wages** — accrued vacation cannot be forfeited upon termination. It must be paid out as part of final wages (Labor Code § 227.3).

**Expense reimbursement is mandatory** — employees cannot waive the right to reimbursement; any such agreement is void.

## Common Employer Errors (What This Package Prevents)

1. Calculating overtime on base rate without including non-discretionary bonuses in the regular rate
2. Scheduling meal periods "sometime after 5 hours" instead of "before the end of the 5th hour"
3. Treating rest periods as unpaid — rest periods are always paid
4. Telling employees to clock out while finishing work tasks
5. Failing to update Wage Theft Prevention Notice each January with new minimum wage
6. Missing pay stub elements — specifically omitting sick leave balance
7. Issuing final pay on the next payday instead of immediately at termination
8. Having a "use-it-or-lose-it" vacation policy (illegal in California)
9. Paying a shift supervisor as exempt without confirming the 50%+ duties test
