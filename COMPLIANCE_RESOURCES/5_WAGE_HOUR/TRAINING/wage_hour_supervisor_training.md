## MODULE 1 — WHY WAGE & HOUR MATTERS
*[10 minutes]*

---

**[OPEN — Say:]**

"Wage and hour law is the area of California employment law where employers get hit hardest — financially and reputationally. Unlike harassment cases, wage and hour violations don't require intent. You don't have to mean to shortchange someone. A bad payroll process, an unclear break policy, or one misclassified employee can expose the company to claims covering every employee in the same classification — for up to four years back."

---

**[THE STAKES — Cover each:]**

"Let me give you a sense of the exposure:

- **Missed meal period:** One additional hour of pay per occurrence. For a 20-person team where employees miss one meal period per week, that's 20 hours of premium pay every week — over a year, over four years, that's significant liability.

- **Non-compliant pay stubs:** $50 to $200 per employee per pay period. If 30 employees receive 26 pay stubs in a year with a missing field, that's potentially $156,000 in penalties — plus PAGA civil penalties on top.

- **PAGA:** The Private Attorneys General Act lets employees sue for Labor Code violations on behalf of every similarly-situated employee. One employee filing a PAGA claim can represent your entire workforce. The notice requirement means you have a short window to fix violations before litigation begins.

- **Waiting time penalties:** Fail to pay a terminated employee on time — even by a day — and you're on the hook for up to 30 days of daily wages per employee.

These aren't hypothetical numbers. California wage and hour litigation is among the most active employment litigation in the country."

---

**[SUPERVISORS ARE THE FRONT LINE — Say:]**

"You are the people who create or prevent these violations. You set the schedules. You know when someone works through lunch. You know when someone is clocking out and still working. If you see it and don't act — the company is liable. If you're causing it — that's worse.

Your job today is to understand what the rules are so you can follow them and enforce them."

---

## MODULE 2 — MINIMUM WAGE, HOURS WORKED, AND OFF-THE-CLOCK
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[MINIMUM WAGE — Say:]**

"Effective January 1, 2026: **$16.90 per hour** statewide. That's the floor. Some jurisdictions are higher."

"[COMPANY LOCATION specifics: if in LA area — 'For work performed in unincorporated LA County, the rate is $17.81. If your employees do mobile work across jurisdictions, the higher rate applies to the hours worked in that area.']"

"The salary threshold for exempt employees is $70,304 per year. We'll come back to that."

---

**[HOURS WORKED — The core concept — Say:]**

"'Hours worked' under California law means: all the time the employer **controls** the employee — whether or not useful, whether or not authorized.

Here's the critical part: if you **know** an employee is working, and you don't stop it, you owe them pay. It doesn't matter that you didn't ask them to do it."

---

**[OFF-THE-CLOCK — The supervisor's obligation — Say:]**

"Off-the-clock work is illegal. Period. Three common scenarios where supervisors accidentally create this problem:

**Scenario 1:** You tell someone to clock out at 5:00, but you then ask them a 'quick question' that turns into a 15-minute conversation. Those 15 minutes are compensable.

**Scenario 2:** An employee is behind on a task and says 'I'll just stay a few minutes after to finish.' If you know about it and don't report it, those minutes are compensable — and if it's a pattern, you have an off-the-clock problem.

**Scenario 3:** You send work texts or emails after the employee has clocked out. If they respond and do work, that's compensable time.

Your obligation: if you see it, stop it and report it. Do not normalize it. Do not reward it by praising someone who 'works extra.' Pay them."

---

**[WHAT'S NOT COMPENSABLE — clarify:]**

"Normal commute: not compensable. Lunch break when they're fully relieved: not compensable. But: if your employee drives from the office to a client meeting and back, that drive time is compensable. If someone eats lunch at their desk while working, that's compensable. The test is always: are they under your control or performing work?"

---

## MODULE 3 — OVERTIME: CALIFORNIA VS. FEDERAL
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[THE CALIFORNIA DAILY OVERTIME RULE — The key differentiator — Say:]**

"This is where California is completely different from federal law. Under federal FLSA, overtime kicks in after 40 hours in a week. California adds **daily overtime**.

Here are the California rules:
- Over 8 hours in a day: **time and a half** (1.5×)
- Over 12 hours in a day: **double time** (2×)
- First 8 hours on the **7th consecutive day** in a workweek: **time and a half**
- Over 8 hours on the **7th consecutive day**: **double time**

These are in addition to — not instead of — weekly overtime. So an employee who works 9 hours on Monday earns one hour of overtime, regardless of how many hours they work the rest of the week."

---

**[REGULAR RATE OF PAY — Most common error area — Say:]**

"Overtime is calculated on the **regular rate of pay** — not just the base hourly rate. If you pay a production bonus, an attendance bonus, or a shift differential, those amounts must be included in the regular rate calculation before you compute overtime.

Example: An employee earns $18/hour and receives a $200 production bonus in a week. Their total straight-time earnings including the bonus must be divided by hours worked to get the true regular rate — and overtime is calculated on THAT rate, not $18.

This is one of the most common underpaid overtime errors in California. If your payroll system computes overtime on base rate only without including non-discretionary bonuses, you have a problem. Bring it to HR or payroll immediately."

---

**[THE WORKWEEK — Say:]**

"Overtime is calculated by workweek — a fixed, regularly recurring period of 168 hours. Our workweek is [MONDAY–SUNDAY / DEFINE]. You cannot average hours across two weeks to avoid overtime. If an employee works 50 hours in week 1 and 30 hours in week 2, you owe overtime for 10 hours in week 1. Period."

---

**[SUPERVISOR OVERTIME PRACTICES — Say:]**

"A few practices that create overtime liability:
- Adjusting timecards to reduce recorded hours — a Labor Code violation and potential wage theft
- Telling employees to take an extra-long lunch to 'avoid' overtime — the time worked still counts
- Sending employees home early one day to offset overtime another — does not eliminate overtime already earned
- Promising comp time instead of overtime pay — **not permitted in California private sector**"

---

## MODULE 4 — MEAL AND REST PERIODS
*[20 minutes]*

---

**[MEAL PERIODS — INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"This is the area where I see the most supervisor-caused violations. The rules are specific and the penalties are automatic."

---

**[THE MEAL PERIOD RULES — Cover precisely:]**

"Non-exempt employees working more than 5 hours must receive a **30-minute uninterrupted meal period** before the end of the 5th hour.

Over 10 hours: a second meal period is required before the end of the 10th hour.

A meal period is only valid if the employee is:
1. **Completely relieved of all duties**
2. **Free to leave the premises**
3. **Given a full 30 uninterrupted minutes**

If any of those three conditions are not met — even for one minute — it's not a valid meal period. The entire break becomes compensable time, AND the company owes one hour of premium pay."

---

**[THE PENALTY — Make it concrete — Say:]**

"One missed meal period = one additional hour of pay at the employee's regular rate. That's the labor code penalty. On top of that, PAGA allows civil penalties of $100 per employee per pay period.

Scenario: Your team of 15 non-exempt employees frequently works through the first half of their lunch to finish a task before the break room opens. That's one missed meal period per employee per day. Over a year — $16.90 × 15 employees × 5 days × 50 weeks = **$63,375 in meal period premiums alone**. Plus PAGA exposure."

---

**[WHAT SUPERVISORS MUST DO — Say:]**

"Your obligation:
1. **Schedule** meal periods to occur before the end of the 5th hour
2. **Relieve** employees of all duties when their meal period starts
3. **Never** ask an employee to work through lunch — or worse, suggest that working through lunch is valued or rewarded
4. **Never** interrupt a meal period for a work question
5. **Never** assume someone clocking back in early means they're choosing to waive their break

If an employee tells you they don't want a meal break — document the discussion, ensure it's genuinely voluntary, and for shifts over 5 hours, only a written waiver is valid for a shift of 6 hours or less."

---

**[REST PERIODS — Say:]**

"Rest periods: 10 paid minutes for every 4 hours worked (or major fraction thereof).

Rest periods:
- Are **paid** — the employee stays on the clock
- Must be at least 10 uninterrupted minutes
- Must be authorized and permitted — not just theoretically available
- Missing a rest period: one hour of premium pay, just like meal periods

Per *Brinker* (2012), the obligation is to **authorize and permit** rest periods — which means actively telling employees they can take them, not just having a policy that says they can."

---

**[SCENARIO — Ask:]**

"It's 2:45 PM. Your team starts at 7 AM. An employee has worked through lunch (you know about this) and hasn't taken a break since 12:30. What should have happened, what did happen, and what do you owe?

*[Discuss. Answer: Employee should have received a meal period by 12:00 (end of 5th hour), a first rest break around 9:30, and a second rest break around 1:30. With a missed meal period and likely missed second rest, the company owes at least 2 hours of premium pay.]*"

---

## MODULE 5 — EXEMPT VS. NON-EXEMPT: RED FLAGS
*[15 minutes]*

---

**[INTRODUCE — Say:]**

"Classification is HR's decision — not yours. But supervisors are often the first to notice when a classification doesn't match reality. Here are the red flags you should bring to HR."

---

**[RED FLAG 1: The Salary Drop Below Threshold]**

"The exempt salary threshold is **$70,304/year in 2026**. It goes up every January with the minimum wage. If you have a salaried employee who's been at the same salary for several years, and that salary is now close to the threshold — flag it for HR immediately. Underpaying an exempt employee below the threshold converts them to non-exempt retroactively."

---

**[RED FLAG 2: The 'Manager' Who Mostly Does Non-Exempt Work]**

"California requires that an exempt employee spend **more than 50% of their time** performing exempt duties. If you have an 'assistant manager' who spends most of their shift doing the same tasks as hourly employees — stocking, serving, cleaning — and only occasionally supervises, that person may not qualify for the executive exemption. Bring it to HR."

---

**[RED FLAG 3: Docking Pay for Quality or Quantity of Work]**

"If an exempt employee is absent for partial days or performs unsatisfactory work and you're thinking about reducing their paycheck — stop. Deducting from an exempt employee's salary based on quantity or quality of work destroys the exemption. Consult HR before any pay adjustments to salaried employees."

---

**[RED FLAG 4: The Independent Contractor Who Isn't]**

"California uses the **ABC test** (Labor Code § 2750.3) to determine independent contractor status. Under this test, all three factors must be met to classify someone as an independent contractor:
- A: Free from the employer's control and direction
- B: Performs work outside the usual course of the company's business
- C: Customarily engaged in an independently established trade

If you're using 'contractors' who work your hours, use your equipment, and do the same work as your employees — that's misclassification. The penalties are severe. Talk to HR."

---

## MODULE 6 — SCENARIO WORKSHOP
*[10 minutes]*

---

**Scenario 1: The Early Clock-Out**

"Two of your employees routinely clock out at exactly 5:00 PM because the system closes. You know they're often still finishing tasks until 5:15. What do you do?"

*[Answer: Stop the practice. Report the time accurately. Pay the extra 15 minutes. Fix the timekeeping system so it doesn't pressure employees to clock out early.]*

---

**Scenario 2: The Working Lunch**

"An employee eats at their desk and responds to a few emails during their 30-minute lunch. They say they don't mind and they're done at 12:30. Is the meal period valid?"

*[Answer: No. Working during a meal period — even voluntarily — means the employee was not fully relieved of duty. The meal period is invalid. Pay the premium. Fix the expectation that emails need to be answered at lunch.]*

---

**Scenario 3: The Bonus Surprise**

"You give your team a $500 bonus for finishing a project. Payroll calculates overtime for that week at the normal rate. Is that correct?"

*[Answer: Likely no. A non-discretionary bonus (tied to meeting a performance target) must be factored into the regular rate of pay for the week. Overtime for that week must be recalculated. This is a common audit finding.]*

---

## MODULE 7 — Q&A + SIGN-IN
*[5 minutes]*

---

"Key takeaways:
1. If an employee is working and you know it — you owe them pay.
2. Daily overtime in California triggers at 8 hours — not 40 hours for the week.
3. A missed meal or rest period = one hour of premium pay, per occurrence.
4. Classification questions go to HR — don't make independent calls.
5. When in doubt: pay it and fix the system."
