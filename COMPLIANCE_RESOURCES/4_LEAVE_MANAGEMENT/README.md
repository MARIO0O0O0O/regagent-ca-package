## Key Compliance Points

**CFRA coverage at 5 employees** (since SB 1383, Jan. 1, 2021) — applies to most California employers.

**PDL has no service requirement** — available from Day 1 to all employees at 5+ employee companies.

**Leave chaining** — PDL and CFRA are always sequential (never concurrent). PDL and FMLA are concurrent at 50+ employee companies.

**Maximum pregnancy leave** — approximately 7 months of job-protected leave (4 months PDL + 12 weeks CFRA bonding).

**Sanchez v. Swissport** — exhausting statutory leave does not authorize termination. Interactive process required first.

**SB 848 (2024)** — 5 days of protected leave for reproductive loss (miscarriage, failed IVF, stillbirth, failed adoption/surrogacy). Extremely confidential.

**AB 406 (2026)** — PSL may now be used to attend judicial proceedings as a crime victim.

**Three-file rule** — medical certifications and leave records must be maintained separately from the standard personnel file.

## Common Employer Errors (What This Package Prevents)

1. Terminating an employee on the day CFRA expires — without engaging in the interactive process
2. Telling employees PDL and CFRA run simultaneously — they are always sequential
3. Disclosing leave reason or diagnosis to supervisors
4. Failing to designate leave when the employer has knowledge of a qualifying reason
5. Counting CFRA/PDL absences in attendance/no-fault disciplinary programs
6. Applying the FMLA key employee exception to CFRA reinstatement rights
7. Requiring employees to use sick leave for purposes not permitted by PSL law
