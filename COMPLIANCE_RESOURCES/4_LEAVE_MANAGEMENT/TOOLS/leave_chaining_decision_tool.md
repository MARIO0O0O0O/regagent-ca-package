# CALIFORNIA LEAVE CHAINING DECISION TOOL
## Quick Reference for HR and Leave Administrators

**Purpose:** Navigate leave concurrency and sequencing for common California scenarios  
**Authority:** CFRA (Gov. Code § 12945.2) | PDL (Gov. Code § 12945) | FMLA (29 U.S.C. § 2601) | Sanchez v. Swissport (2013)

---

## STEP 1: DETERMINE APPLICABLE LAWS

**Is the employer covered by CFRA?**
- 5+ total employees → YES (applies since SB 1383, eff. Jan. 1, 2021)
- Fewer than 5 employees → NO

**Is the employer covered by FMLA?**
- 50+ employees for 20+ workweeks in current or preceding calendar year → YES
- Fewer than 50 employees → NO (CFRA still applies at 5+)

**Is the employer covered by PDL?**
- 5+ employees → YES (always, regardless of FMLA coverage)

---

## STEP 2: IS THE EMPLOYEE ELIGIBLE?

### CFRA / FMLA Eligibility

| Requirement | CFRA | FMLA |
|-------------|------|------|
| Months of service | 12 months | 12 months |
| Hours worked | 1,250 in preceding 12 months | 1,250 in preceding 12 months |
| Location size | 5+ employees within 75 miles | 50+ employees within 75 miles |

### PDL Eligibility

All employees are eligible from **Day 1**. No service or hours requirement.

### PSL Eligibility

All employees accrue from Day 1; may use beginning on **Day 90**.

---

## STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE LEAVE TYPE

| Situation | Leave Type(s) |
|-----------|--------------|
| Employee disabled by pregnancy, prenatal care, postpartum | PDL |
| Employee's own serious health condition (non-pregnancy) | CFRA |
| Caring for seriously ill family member | CFRA |
| Baby bonding after birth/adoption/foster | CFRA |
| Employee disabled by pregnancy AND employer has 50+ employees | PDL + FMLA concurrent |
| Reproductive loss (miscarriage, failed IVF, stillbirth, etc.) | SB 848 |
| Own illness (any) — short-term | PSL |
| Care for family member — any reason | PSL |

---

## STEP 4: DETERMINE CONCURRENCY OR SEQUENCE

### RULE 1 — PDL and CFRA are NEVER concurrent
PDL and CFRA run **sequentially** — PDL first, CFRA bonding after PDL ends.

### RULE 2 — PDL and FMLA ARE concurrent (50+ employee employers)
For employers with 50+ employees, FMLA (which covers pregnancy as a serious health condition) runs simultaneously with PDL.

### RULE 3 — CFRA and FMLA are generally concurrent (50+ employee employers)
After PDL, CFRA bonding and remaining FMLA run together.

### RULE 4 — PSL and CFRA/PDL can overlap
An employee may use (or be required to use) accrued PSL or vacation concurrently with CFRA or PDL.

## SCENARIO REFERENCE CHARTS

### Scenario A: Pregnancy Leave — 5 to 49 Employees (CFRA only)

```
TIMELINE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[         PDL — up to 4 months (17.3 wks)        ][ CFRA BONDING — 12 wks ]
 Day 1                                          PDL end             CFRA end

WAGE REPLACEMENT: SDI (60–70%, up to 52 wks)    PFL (60–70%, up to 8 wks)
JOB PROTECTION:   PDL                             CFRA
```

**Maximum total job-protected leave:** ~29 weeks (7+ months)

---

### Scenario B: Pregnancy Leave — 50+ Employees (CFRA + FMLA)

```
TIMELINE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[    PDL — up to 17.3 wks                        ][ CFRA BONDING — 12 wks ]
[  FMLA — 12 wks concurrent ──────────]           [Remaining FMLA if any  ]
 Day 1                              Week 12      PDL end            CFRA end

Example: Employee takes 17 wks PDL
  FMLA is exhausted at week 12 of PDL
  After PDL: 12 wks CFRA bonding; FMLA already used
  Total: 17 + 12 = 29 weeks
```

---

### Scenario C: Employee's Own Serious Health Condition (not pregnancy)

```
TIMELINE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[ CFRA — 12 weeks ]
[ FMLA — 12 weeks (concurrent, if 50+ employer) ]
  Day 1          Week 12

Note: After 12 weeks CFRA/FMLA, employer must still engage in INTERACTIVE
PROCESS if employee remains disabled. Additional leave may be required as
reasonable accommodation (Sanchez v. Swissport).
```

---

### Scenario D: Multiple Qualifying Events in Same Year

```
Example: Employee takes 12 wks CFRA for own illness (Jan–Mar)
         Then takes 5 days SB 848 for miscarriage (June)
         
CFRA: 12 weeks used — full entitlement exhausted
SB 848: Separate entitlement — 5 days available (up to 20 days/yr for SB 848)
PSL: Can be used throughout; separate entitlement

Key: SB 848 is a separate entitlement from CFRA. Using CFRA does not
     deplete SB 848, and vice versa.
```

---

## STEP 5: POST-EXHAUSTION — THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS

When an employee's statutory leave is exhausted and they remain unable to return:

**DO NOT TERMINATE IMMEDIATELY.**

### Required Steps

**Step 1 — Initiate Contact**
- HR contacts the employee before or upon leave exhaustion
- Ask: Is the employee still unable to return? What is the expected return timeline?

**Step 2 — Request Medical Documentation**
- Request updated documentation of current disability and expected duration
- Set a reasonable deadline (10–15 business days)

**Step 3 — Explore Accommodations**
Ask and document each option:
- [ ] Extended unpaid leave — how long is needed?
- [ ] Modified duties or work schedule
- [ ] Remote work (full or partial)
- [ ] Transfer to a vacant equivalent position
- [ ] Part-time return with gradual increase

**Step 4 — Evaluate Undue Hardship (if applicable)**
Document the hardship analysis:
- How long has the position been vacant?
- What is the cost of continued vacancy or temp coverage?
- What is the size and financial resources of the company?
- What is the nature of the position?

**Step 5 — Document and Decide**
- Document every communication, every option explored, every response
- If accommodation is offered: document acceptance or rejection
- If undue hardship is found: document the analysis
- If termination is necessary: consult legal counsel before proceeding

> **Litigation risk:** The most common FEHA leave claim is failure to engage in the interactive process in good faith. Courts look for evidence that both parties tried. Documentation is your defense.
