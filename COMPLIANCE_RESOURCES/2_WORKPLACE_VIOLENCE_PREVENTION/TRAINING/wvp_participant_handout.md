## EMERGENCY RESPONSE — RUN, HIDE, FIGHT

**Run** — Get out if you safely can. Alert others. Call 911.

**Hide** — If you can't run: lock/barricade door, silence phone, text 911 if you can't call safely.

**Fight** — Last resort only. Act with aggression and commitment. Use anything available.

## DE-ESCALATION — WHEN SOMEONE IS ESCALATING

- Give them space — don't crowd, don't block their exit
- Keep your voice calm and low — don't match their energy
- Acknowledge frustration: *"I can see you're upset. I want to help."*
- Don't argue, don't threaten, don't issue ultimatums
- Know when to exit and get help — you are never required to absorb threatening behavior
