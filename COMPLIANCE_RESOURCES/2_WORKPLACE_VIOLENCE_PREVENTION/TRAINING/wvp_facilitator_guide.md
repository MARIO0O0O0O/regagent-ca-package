## DETAILED FACILITATOR SCRIPT

### ⏱️ 0:00–0:05 — WELCOME & LEGAL CONTEXT

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. My name is [YOUR NAME] and today we're conducting [COMPANY NAME]'s annual Workplace Violence Prevention Training, which California law now requires under SB 553, effective since July 2024.
>
> This training covers [COMPANY NAME]'s Workplace Violence Prevention Plan — our written plan that Cal/OSHA can inspect at any time. You'll receive a summary of that plan today.
>
> Unlike our harassment prevention training, there's no supervisor track versus employee track for this one — this training is the same for everyone, because workplace safety is everyone's responsibility. And it's annual, not every two years.
>
> Any questions before we start?"

---

### ⏱️ 0:05–0:20 — MODULE 1: UNDERSTANDING WORKPLACE VIOLENCE (15 min)

#### SLIDE: "What Is Workplace Violence?"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Cal/OSHA defines workplace violence as any act of violence or threat of violence that occurs at or is related to a place of employment. Let me break that down.
>
> It includes physical assault — obviously. But it also includes threats. It includes aggressive behavior that causes a reasonable person to be afraid. You don't need to be physically touched. You don't need to be injured. A credible threat alone qualifies.
>
> It includes property damage with violent intent — someone throwing things, smashing equipment. And it extends to off-site work activities — if you're visiting a client, making a delivery, or working remotely and something happens, our plan covers you."

#### SLIDE: "4 Types of Workplace Violence"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "The research classifies workplace violence into four types, and understanding which type you're dealing with shapes how you respond.
>
> Type I is criminal intent — someone with no connection to us. A robbery, a break-in, vandalism. The perpetrator targets us as a location, not any specific person.
>
> Type II is customer or client violence — the most common type in most industries. An angry customer, a frustrated patient, someone who feels they've been wronged. They know who we are but the relationship is transactional.
>
> Type III is worker-on-worker. This could be a conflict between coworkers, a grudge, or someone's behavior after being disciplined or terminated. This type is particularly important because warning signs are often visible beforehand.
>
> Type IV is personal relationship violence — domestic violence that follows someone to work. An abusive partner shows up. A stalker targets someone at their workplace. This is more common than most people realize, and our plan addresses it."

💬 **DISCUSSION PROMPT:**
> "Which of these four types do you think is most relevant to our workplace? Why?"
*(Allow 2–3 responses. Affirm each — this gets people thinking about their actual environment, not abstract scenarios.)*

#### SLIDE: "Threat Levels"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Not all threats carry the same risk. We use three levels:
>
> Level 1 is vague or indirect — generalized statements, frustrated language, no specific target or plan. 'Someone should teach them a lesson.' These still need to be reported.
>
> Level 2 is direct — a specific target is named. 'I'm going to hurt [name].' This is serious and requires immediate reporting and assessment.
>
> Level 3 is imminent — specific target, specific plan, the means to carry it out, and a timeframe. This is a 911 situation first, report to HR and management second.
>
> The key point: **all three levels get reported.** You don't need to assess the level yourself. That's our job. Your job is to tell someone."

### ⏱️ 0:20–0:35 — MODULE 2: PREVENTION & EARLY WARNING SIGNS (15 min)

#### SLIDE: "Behavioral Warning Signs"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "One of the most valuable prevention tools we have is recognizing behavioral changes that can precede violence. These are not accusations — they are signals that someone may be in distress and that early intervention could prevent something worse.
>
> Report to your supervisor or HR if you observe: statements about harming self or others, even if you think they're joking. Increased fascination with weapons or violent events. Significant mood changes — someone who's normally calm becoming very agitated, or someone withdrawing suddenly. Inability to accept feedback or criticism. Escalating paranoia or holding grudges. Substance abuse at work.
>
> And importantly: situational triggers. When someone receives discipline, faces a termination, is going through a difficult personal situation — these are the moments when distress peaks. More supervision and more contact, not less, is the right response during high-stress periods."

#### SLIDE: "Situational Triggers"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Some situations are statistically higher-risk. A few worth highlighting:
>
> Terminations. Many workplace violence incidents in the worker-on-worker category follow a termination. We have specific protocols for how terminations are conducted to reduce risk.
>
> Restraining orders. If an employee obtains a restraining order against someone, we need to know — immediately. We can implement security measures, alter work schedules, and coordinate with law enforcement. This is confidential. No other employee needs to know the details. But HR and security need to know.
>
> Lone worker situations. Employees working alone, after hours, in isolated areas face elevated risk. Know the check-in procedures for your role. [Reference company-specific lone worker protocols if applicable.]"

💬 **SCENARIO DISCUSSION:**
> "A coworker has been acting differently for the past few weeks — short-tempered, making a couple of comments like 'everyone's going to get what's coming to them.' You think he's just stressed. He's never been violent.
>
> Do you say something? To whom? What do you actually do?"

*(Discussion goal: lower the threshold for reporting. The answer is yes — you report it, and you report it to your supervisor or HR, not to the person. 'Better safe than sorry' is the correct instinct.)*

### ⏱️ 0:35–0:50 — MODULE 3: RESPONSE & REPORTING (15 min)

#### SLIDE: "Active Threat — Run, Hide, Fight"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "In an active threat situation — meaning imminent physical danger — the standard response framework is Run, Hide, Fight.
>
> Run first. If you can get out safely, get out. Alert others if you can without putting yourself at risk. Once you're out, call 911. Do not go back in.
>
> Hide if you can't run. Secure the area — lock doors, barricade if possible, silence your phone. Stay hidden and quiet. Text 911 if you can't call safely.
>
> Fight only as a last resort — if your life is in immediate danger and you have no other option. Use anything available. Act with aggression and commit to it.
>
> I want to be clear: our goal is never to encourage heroics. The goal is survival."

#### SLIDE: "De-Escalation for Aggressive Behavior"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Most situations are not active threats. Most are escalating situations — an angry customer, a heated argument between coworkers — where early intervention can prevent things from getting worse.
>
> When you encounter someone who is escalating, a few principles:
>
> Give them space. Don't crowd, don't touch, don't block their exit.
>
> Keep your voice calm and low. Don't match their energy or volume. Don't argue.
>
> Acknowledge their frustration. 'I can see you're upset. I want to help.' This is not agreement — it's validation, and it reduces escalation.
>
> Don't threaten. Don't issue ultimatums in the moment. The goal is to get them calmer so the situation can be addressed.
>
> Know when to disengage and get help. If someone is not responding to de-escalation, your job is to exit the situation and get your supervisor or call for assistance. You are never required to absorb threatening behavior in the name of customer service."

#### SLIDE: "Reporting at [COMPANY NAME]"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "For any workplace violence incident or concerning behavior — report it. You have several options:
>
> Immediate threat or emergency: Call 911 first.
>
> Non-emergency incidents, threats, or concerning behavior: Report to your supervisor immediately. Also report to HR or the Plan Administrator: [NAME] at [EMAIL] / [PHONE].
>
> If you don't feel comfortable reporting to your supervisor: Go directly to HR.
>
> All reports are investigated. You are protected from retaliation for making a good-faith report. Our violent incident log documents every report and maintains a 5-year record.
>
> And a critical note: no report is too small. Near-misses, concerning comments, observations about a coworker's behavior — all of it is worth reporting. We'd rather investigate and find nothing than miss a warning sign."

#### SLIDE: "Emergency Numbers — [COMPANY NAME]"

> **[FACILITATOR NOTE: Keep this on screen during the next section so participants can write them down]**

| Situation | Contact |
|-----------|---------|
| Active threat / immediate danger | 911 |
| [COMPANY NAME] Plan Administrator | [NAME] — [PHONE] |
| Human Resources | [NAME] — [PHONE] |
| Security (if applicable) | [PHONE] |
| [COMPANY NAME] Anonymous Tip | [PHONE / URL] |
| Cal/OSHA | 1-800-963-9424 |

> "These are also in your handout. Please save the Plan Administrator and HR numbers in your phone."

💬 **FINAL DISCUSSION:**
> "Is there anything about our workplace — our specific location, our type of work, our customer base — that makes you think about safety differently after this training? Any gaps you've noticed that we should address?"

*(This is valuable input for the annual WVPP review. Capture anything significant and bring it to the plan administrator.)*

### ⏱️ 0:50–0:58 — WRAP-UP & Q&A (8 min)

#### SLIDE: "5 Things to Remember"

> **[READ ALOUD]**
> "Let me close with five things I want you to carry out of here today:
>
> One — Workplace violence includes threats, not just physical acts. Report threats.
>
> Two — Report every incident and every concern, no matter how small it seems. Early reporting saves lives.
>
> Three — You are protected from retaliation for reporting in good faith.
>
> Four — In an active threat: Run, Hide, Fight — in that order.
>
> Five — De-escalation is a skill, not a personality trait. Use the principles we covered.
>
> Any questions?"

### ⏱️ 0:58–1:00 — SIGN-IN & ACKNOWLEDGMENT

> "Please sign the training roster and the acknowledgment form before you go. The acknowledgment confirms you received this training and reviewed our WVPP summary.
>
> This training is annual, so you'll see us again this time next year. Thank you for your time."
