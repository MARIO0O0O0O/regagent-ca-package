## What is SB 553?

Senate Bill 553, signed by Governor Newsom in September 2023, requires California employers to establish, implement, and maintain an effective Workplace Violence Prevention Plan (WVPP). This law recognizes that workplace violence is a serious occupational safety hazard.

### Types of Workplace Violence Covered:

**Type I: Criminal Intent**
- Perpetrator has no relationship to business
- Examples: Robbery, trespassing, vandalism

**Type II: Customer/Client**
- Perpetrator is a customer, client, patient, or visitor
- Examples: Angry customer, aggressive patient

**Type III: Worker-on-Worker**
- Perpetrator is current or former employee
- Examples: Bullying, fights, threats

**Type IV: Personal Relationship**
- Perpetrator has personal relationship with employee
- Examples: Domestic violence entering workplace

### What Counts as "Workplace Violence"?

SB 553 defines workplace violence as:
- Physical assault
- Threats of physical harm
- Aggressive behavior creating reasonable fear
- Intimidation attempts
- Verbal abuse that creates fear

**Important:** The threat doesn't have to be carried out to require reporting and response.

---

## Who Must Comply?

**Almost all California employers must comply**, with very limited exceptions.

### Covered Employers:
✅ Private businesses (all sizes)
✅ Nonprofits
✅ Most healthcare facilities
✅ Retail and hospitality
✅ Educational institutions
✅ Office environments

### Limited Exemptions:

The following employers are **exempt** from written plan requirements but must still prevent workplace violence:

1. Establishments with <10 employees working at all times
2. Law enforcement agencies
3. Certain healthcare and social services facilities already covered by Title 8, CCR §3342

**Important for LA Businesses:** Even if you're exempt from the written plan, you're not exempt from preventing workplace violence. Cal/OSHA can still cite you for unsafe conditions.

---

## Creating Your Violence Prevention Plan

### Step 1: Establish Responsibility

**Identify the following:**

**Plan [POSITION]:**
- Name and title of person responsible for plan
- Contact information
- Authority to implement plan

**Safety Committee (if applicable):**
- Representatives from various departments
- Meets at least quarterly
- Reviews incidents and makes recommendations

**Sample Language:**
```
[Name], [Title] is responsible for implementing and maintaining 
this Workplace Violence Prevention Plan. Employees may report 
concerns to [Name] at [Email] or [Phone].
```

### Step 2: Conduct Workplace Evaluation

**Assess these factors:**

**Physical Environment:**
- Public access points
- Lighting adequacy
- Blind spots or isolated areas
- Cash handling locations
- Parking lot safety

**Work Practices:**
- Lone worker situations
- Late-night operations
- Customer interaction protocols
- Cash handling procedures

**History:**
- Past incidents or threats
- Employee concerns
- Industry-specific risks
- Neighborhood crime data

**Sample Evaluation Checklist:**
```
☐ Are entrances visible from staff areas?
☐ Is adequate lighting provided in all areas?
☐ Are there procedures for handling aggressive customers?
☐ Do employees work alone at night?
☐ Is there a panic button or silent alarm system?
☐ Have employees reported feeling unsafe?
☐ Are there high-crime areas nearby?
```

### Step 3: Identify Hazards and Corrective Measures

**Common Hazards and Solutions:**

| Hazard | Corrective Measure |
|--------|-------------------|
| Uncontrolled public access | Install locks, visitor check-in system |
| Poor lighting | Upgrade exterior/parking lot lighting |
| Isolated work areas | Implement buddy system, check-in procedures |
| Cash handling | Use time-delay safes, post minimal cash signs |
| Aggressive customers | Training, de-escalation protocols, security |
| No emergency communication | Install panic buttons, mobile alert system |

### Step 4: Document Incident Reporting Procedures

**Your plan must include:**

**How to Report:**
- Who to report to (name, title, contact)
- Phone number for emergencies (usually 911)
- Non-emergency reporting method
- Anonymous reporting option

**What to Report:**
- Any threat or actual violence
- Aggressive behavior
- Intimidation attempts
- Property damage with violent intent

**Reporting Protections:**
- No retaliation for good faith reports
- Confidentiality (to extent possible)
- Right to refuse unsafe work

**Sample Reporting Language:**
```
Report any workplace violence incident or threat immediately to:

Emergency (immediate danger): Call 911, then notify [[POSITION]]

Non-emergency: Report to [Name] at [Phone/Email] within 24 hours

You may also submit anonymous reports via [method]

Employees will not be retaliated against for reporting workplace 
violence concerns in good faith.
```

### Step 5: Outline Emergency Response Procedures

**Include these protocols:**

**Active Threat Situation:**
1. Run: Evacuate if safe route available
2. Hide: Lock doors, turn off lights, silence phones
3. Fight: As last resort, use any objects as weapons
4. After incident: Call 911, render first aid if trained

**Aggressive Individual:**
1. Stay calm and maintain distance
2. Don't turn your back
3. Alert coworkers/security
4. Remove other people from area
5. Call 911 if threat escalates

**Bomb Threat:**
1. Keep caller on line if possible
2. Note exact wording of threat
3. Evacuate according to plan
4. Call 911 from safe location

**Domestic Violence Situation:**
1. Contact law enforcement immediately
2. Assist victim to safe location
3. Implement any protective order provisions
4. Document incident

### Step 6: Establish Hazard Correction Procedures

**Your plan must describe:**

**Immediate Correction:**
- Hazards corrected on discovery
- Who has authority to implement
- Temporary measures if needed

**Long-Term Correction:**
- Capital improvements (lighting, locks)
- Policy changes
- Training needs
- Timeline for implementation

**Sample Correction Language:**
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a plan if I've never had a violent incident?

Yes. SB 553 requires a plan regardless of incident history. The goal is prevention, not just reaction.

### Can I use a generic template from the internet?

Templates are a starting point, but your plan must be specific to your workplace. Generic plans don't satisfy Cal/OSHA requirements.

### What if an employee refuses violence prevention training?

Training is mandatory. Refusal can be grounds for discipline, up to termination (document refusal attempts).

### Do I have to report every argument between employees?

Report any incident involving threats, physical contact, or behavior creating fear. Minor disagreements don't require logging.

### What if a customer threatens an employee?

This is a Type II incident. Log it, investigate, and determine if corrective actions are needed (security, banned customer list, training).

### Can I be cited even with a plan in place?

Yes, if the plan is inadequate, not followed, or incidents aren't properly investigated. Having a plan is not enough—it must be effective.

### What about work-from-home employees?

SB 553 applies to physical workplaces. Remote workers should be trained on how to report threats and what to do if personal situations (domestic violence) might affect workplace safety.

## Summary: SB 553 Compliance in 4 Steps

**1. Create Your Plan (Week 1-3)**
- Use our template as starting point
- Customize for your workplace
- Document hazards and solutions

**2. Train Your Team (Week 4)**
- All employees, including management
- Document attendance
- Make training interactive

**3. Implement and Track (Ongoing)**
- Log all incidents within 24 hours
- Investigate thoroughly
- Complete corrective actions

**4. Review Annually (Every Year)**
- Update for new hazards
- Review incident trends
- Retrain as needed

**Bottom Line:** SB 553 compliance takes 20-40 hours initially, then 5-10 hours annually. The alternative—Cal/OSHA citations starting at [AMOUNT]—makes compliance the obvious choice.
