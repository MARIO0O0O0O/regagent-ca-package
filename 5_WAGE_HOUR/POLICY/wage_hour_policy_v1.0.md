## 1. MINIMUM WAGE — 2026 RATES

### California Statewide

**Effective January 1, 2026: $16.90 per hour** (all employers, all sizes)

> This rate applies to all non-exempt employees. There is no lower rate for small employers or tipped workers in California.

### Exempt Employee Salary Threshold (2026)

The minimum **annual salary** for white-collar exempt employees is:

**$70,304.00 per year** ($16.90 × 2 × 2,080 hours)

Employees earning less than this threshold cannot qualify as exempt under the executive, administrative, or professional exemptions — regardless of job duties.

### Local Minimum Wages (Los Angeles Area — 2026)

| Jurisdiction | 2026 Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| California (statewide) | $16.90/hr | All employers |
| City of Los Angeles | $17.28/hr (est.) | Verify with LA City |
| Unincorporated LA County | $17.81/hr | Applies to work performed in unincorporated areas |
| El Monte (incorporated) | $16.90/hr (state rate) | Verify for local ordinance updates |
| Fast food workers (AB 1228) | $20.00/hr | Covered fast food establishments |

> **Rule:** The **highest applicable rate** — state, county, or municipal — applies to each hour worked in that jurisdiction. An employee who performs mobile work in unincorporated LA County is entitled to the county rate for those hours.

> **Action required:** [COMPANY NAME] must verify applicable local rates annually each January and update the Wage Theft Prevention Notice (DLSE Form 2810.5) accordingly.

---

## 2. HOURS WORKED — WHAT MUST BE PAID

California requires payment for all **"hours worked"** — defined as time the employer knows or reasonably should know the employee is working, whether or not authorized.

### Compensable Time Includes

- All time under the employer's control, whether or not useful to the employer
- Required pre-shift and post-shift activities (e.g., security screenings, putting on/removing required equipment)
- Mandatory training, meetings, and orientations
- On-call time where restrictions prevent the employee from effectively using the time for personal activities
- Travel time during the workday (not commute to/from home)
- Rest periods (must be paid — see Section 6)
- Waiting time when the employee must wait at the workplace

### Not Compensable

- Bona fide meal periods (if fully relieved of duties — see Section 5)
- Regular commute time between home and work
- Off-the-clock activities not required by the employer

> **Off-the-clock work prohibition:** [COMPANY NAME] prohibits supervisors from requiring, requesting, suggesting, or knowingly permitting non-exempt employees to work off the clock. Employees who work off the clock must report it, and will be paid for the time. Violations by supervisors are grounds for disciplinary action.

---

## 3. OVERTIME — CALIFORNIA RULES

California's overtime rules are significantly more protective than federal FLSA rules. **California law applies.**

### Daily Overtime (California — No Federal Equivalent)

| Hours Worked | Rate |
|-------------|------|
| Over 8 hours in a workday | 1.5× regular rate |
| Over 12 hours in a workday | 2× regular rate |
| 7th consecutive day in a workweek — first 8 hours | 1.5× regular rate |
| 7th consecutive day in a workweek — over 8 hours | 2× regular rate |

### Weekly Overtime

| Hours Worked | Rate |
|-------------|------|
| Over 40 hours in a workweek | 1.5× regular rate |

> **California is more protective than FLSA:** Federal law only requires overtime for hours over 40 in a workweek. California requires overtime for hours over 8 in a workday. Both thresholds must be applied; California's daily overtime frequently triggers first.

### Regular Rate of Pay

The overtime multiplier is applied to the **regular rate of pay** — not just the base hourly wage. The regular rate includes:
- Hourly wages
- Non-discretionary bonuses (shift differentials, production bonuses, attendance bonuses)
- Piece-rate earnings
- Most non-cash compensation with a definite value

**Not included in regular rate:** Overtime premiums already paid, discretionary bonuses, expense reimbursements, gifts, vacation/holiday pay at the same rate.

> **Common error:** Employers who pay a flat production bonus without recalculating the regular rate to include the bonus create underpaid overtime liability across the entire bonus period.

### Alternative Workweek Schedules

[COMPANY NAME] [does / does not] have an adopted alternative workweek schedule (AWS). An AWS allows employees to work up to 10 hours per day without daily overtime, under the following conditions:
- Adopted by secret ballot of affected employees (2/3 majority)
- Registered with the Labor Commissioner
- Specific to an identifiable work unit
- Employees still receive overtime for hours over the scheduled shift and over 40/week

---

## 4. EXEMPT VS. NON-EXEMPT CLASSIFICATION

### Why It Matters

Non-exempt employees are entitled to: minimum wage, daily overtime, weekly overtime, meal periods, rest periods, reporting time pay, and all California Labor Code protections.

Exempt employees are not entitled to overtime or meal/rest break premiums — but must be paid a qualifying salary and must primarily perform qualifying duties.

**Misclassification is one of California's highest-exposure wage and hour violations.**

### The White-Collar Exemptions

To qualify as exempt under executive, administrative, or professional exemptions, an employee must meet **ALL THREE** of the following:

**1. Salary Basis Test**  
The employee must be paid a guaranteed salary of at least **$70,304 per year ($1,352/week)** as of January 1, 2026. The salary cannot be reduced based on the quantity or quality of work.

**2. Salary Level Test**  
Same as salary basis — the amount must meet the current threshold. Verify every January.

**3. Duties Test** (California is stricter than FLSA)

| Exemption | Primary Duty Requirement |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Executive | Management of the enterprise or a recognized subdivision; customarily and regularly directing the work of 2+ employees; authority to hire/fire or whose recommendations are given particular weight |
| Administrative | Office or non-manual work directly related to management or general business operations; exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance |
| Professional | Work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning, customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction |

> **California's "primarily" standard:** California requires that the employee spend **MORE THAN 50%** of their working time performing exempt duties. This is more restrictive than federal law's "primary duty" standard.

### Other Exemptions

- **Computer software professional:** $53.80/hour or $112,065.20/year (2026 — verify annually)
- **Outside salesperson:** Must spend more than 50% of time away from employer's place of business making sales
- **Commissioned salesperson (inside):** Earnings must exceed 1.5× minimum wage and more than 50% of compensation must come from commissions

### Classification Audit Requirement

[COMPANY NAME] reviews all exempt classifications:
- **Annually** — to confirm salary threshold compliance after each January minimum wage increase
- **Whenever** a job changes materially in duties, supervision, or pay structure
- **Upon request** when an employee or their representative raises a classification question

> **When in doubt, classify as non-exempt.** The cost of paying overtime to a properly non-exempt employee is far lower than the penalty exposure from misclassification.

---

## 5. MEAL PERIODS

**Legal Authority:** Labor Code § 512; IWC Wage Orders

### Requirements

| Work Duration | Meal Period Requirement |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Over 5 hours | 1 meal period of at least 30 minutes |
| Over 10 hours | 2 meal periods of at least 30 minutes each |

### Standards

A meal period is legally compliant only if the employee is:
- Relieved of **all duty**
- Free to leave the worksite
- Provided at least **30 uninterrupted minutes**

A meal period during which the employee is required to remain on duty, respond to calls, or perform any work is **not a valid meal period** — the entire 30 minutes becomes compensable work time AND a meal period penalty is triggered.

### Premium Pay (Meal Period Penalty)

If a compliant meal period is not provided, [COMPANY NAME] owes the employee **one additional hour of pay at their regular rate** for each missed, late, short, or interrupted meal period.

This penalty:
- Is owed even if the employee voluntarily skips the meal period
- Applies per occurrence — an employee who misses both meal periods in a 12-hour day is owed 2 hours of premium pay
- Is subject to the 3-year statute of limitations under PAGA
- Is subject to PAGA civil penalties ON TOP of the premium

### Waiver

The first meal period for a shift of 6 hours or less may be waived by mutual written agreement of employer and employee.

The second meal period for a shift of 12 hours or less may be waived if: (1) the first meal period was not waived, and (2) both parties agree in writing.

### On-Duty Meal Period

An on-duty (paid) meal period is permitted only when: (1) the nature of the work prevents relief from all duty (very rare — e.g., sole employee at a location), and (2) a written on-duty meal period agreement is signed.

---

## 6. REST PERIODS

**Legal Authority:** IWC Wage Orders § 12; *Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court* (2012)

### Requirements

Non-exempt employees are entitled to a **10-minute paid rest period** for every **4 hours worked** (or major fraction thereof — interpreted as over 2 hours).

| Hours in Shift | Rest Periods Owed |
|---------------|------------------|
| Less than 3.5 hours | 0 |
| 3.5 to 7 hours | 1 |
| 7 to 11 hours | 2 |
| 11 to 14 hours | 3 |
| 14 to 17 hours | 4 |

### Standards

Rest periods must be:
- **Paid** (unlike meal periods)
- At least **10 minutes** of uninterrupted rest
- The employee must be **relieved of all duty** during the rest period
- Taken in the **middle of each work period** where practicable

### Premium Pay (Rest Period Penalty)

If a compliant rest period is not provided, [COMPANY NAME] owes the employee **one additional hour of pay at their regular rate** for each missed rest period.

This is a separate penalty from the meal period premium — an employee who misses both a meal period and a rest period in the same shift is owed 2 hours of premium pay total.

### Brinker Requirements

Per *Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court* (2012) 53 Cal. 4th 1004, employers must:
- **Authorize and permit** rest periods (making them available is not sufficient if employees don't know they're entitled to take them)
- Relinquish control and not impede or discourage rest periods
- Schedule rest periods as close to the middle of each 4-hour period as practicable

---

## 7. REPORTING TIME PAY

If an employee **reports to work** as scheduled and is:
- Sent home before working at least half of the scheduled shift, OR
- Given less than half the scheduled hours

[COMPANY NAME] must pay:
- **Half the scheduled shift hours** at the regular rate, OR
- **A minimum of 2 hours** and a **maximum of 4 hours** — whichever is greater

**Example:** An employee is scheduled for 8 hours. They show up, and after 1 hour are told to go home. They are owed: half of 8 hours = 4 hours at the regular rate.

**Exception:** Reporting time pay is not owed if the employee could not be put to work due to: acts of God, threats to the employee or property, or public utility failures.

---

## 8. SPLIT SHIFT PREMIUM

A split shift occurs when an employee's workday includes a break in the working schedule of more than 1 hour that is not a bona fide meal period.

If an employee works a split shift, they are entitled to a **split shift premium**: one additional hour of pay at the **minimum wage rate** (not their regular rate).

**Exception:** If the employee's total compensation for the day already exceeds the minimum wage for all hours worked plus the one-hour premium, no additional payment is required.

---

## 9. PAYDAY REQUIREMENTS

**Legal Authority:** Labor Code §§ 204, 207, 208

### Frequency

Non-exempt (hourly) employees must be paid at least **twice per month** on designated paydays.

Exempt employees may be paid **twice per month** or **monthly** per written agreement.

### Payroll Schedule

[COMPANY NAME]'s designated paydays are: _______________

### Payday Posting Requirement

[COMPANY NAME] posts the paydays and the time and place of payment in a location accessible to all employees. (Labor Code § 207)

### Form of Payment

[COMPANY NAME] pays wages by: [ ] Direct deposit  [ ] Check  [ ] Pay card (with employee consent)

Employees must be able to access their wages without fees on their regular payday.

---

## 10. FINAL PAY

**Legal Authority:** Labor Code §§ 201, 202, 227.3

### Timing

| Termination Type | Final Pay Timing |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Employer-initiated termination | **Immediately** at time of termination |
| Employee resignation with 72+ hours notice | Last day of work |
| Employee resignation with less than 72 hours notice | Within 72 hours of notice |
| Employee with different agreement | Per agreement (within the applicable deadline) |

### What Must Be Included

Final pay must include:
- All wages earned through the last day
- All accrued, unused vacation/PTO (treated as vested wages under Labor Code § 227.3 — **cannot be forfeited**)
- All accrued, unused sick leave is **not** required to be paid out (unless company policy provides otherwise)

### Waiting Time Penalties

If [COMPANY NAME] willfully fails to pay final wages on time, the employee is entitled to **one day's wages for each day the final pay is delayed**, up to a **maximum of 30 days** (Labor Code § 203).

At the 2026 minimum wage, this exposure is up to: $16.90 × 8 hours × 30 days = **$4,056 per employee**.

> **Willful** does not require bad intent — courts have found that paying late because of administrative error or lack of payroll funding is willful.

---

## 11. PAY STUBS — REQUIRED INFORMATION

**Legal Authority:** Labor Code § 226

Every pay stub must contain all of the following:

1. Gross wages earned during the pay period
2. Total hours worked (non-exempt employees — and exempt employees paid hourly or on time basis)
3. All deductions (each itemized separately)
4. Net wages
5. Inclusive dates of the pay period
6. Employee's name and last four digits of Social Security Number (or employee ID)

8. Hourly rate(s) in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each rate (non-exempt)
9. **Paid sick leave accrual and balance** (Labor Code § 246(j)) — or a separate document provided with the pay stub

**For piece-rate workers:** Number of piece-rate units earned and applicable piece rate.

### Penalty for Non-Compliant Pay Stubs

Failure to provide an accurate, itemized pay stub subjects the employer to:
- $50 per employee per initial violation
- $100 per employee per subsequent violations
- Up to $4,000 per employee
- PAGA penalties on top (additional $100 per pay period per employee for initial violations)

---

## 12. WAGE THEFT PREVENTION NOTICE (LABOR CODE § 2810.5)

**Required for all non-exempt employees at time of hire and upon any change.**

Every non-exempt employee must receive a written notice at the time of hire containing:

1. Rate of pay (hourly or other basis)
2. Allowances claimed as part of the minimum wage (meals, lodging, tips — if any)
3. Regular payday
4. Name of employer and fictitious business names used

## PAGA EXPOSURE — KNOW YOUR RISK

The Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) allows employees to sue on behalf of themselves and other aggrieved employees for Labor Code violations. Penalties are substantial:

| Violation | PAGA Penalty |
|-----------|-------------|
| Non-compliant pay stub | $100/employee/pay period (initial); $200 (subsequent) |
| Failure to pay minimum wage | $100/employee/pay period (initial); $250 (subsequent) |
| Missed meal period (no premium paid) | $100/employee/pay period (initial); $200 (subsequent) |
| Missed rest period (no premium paid) | $100/employee/pay period (initial); $200 (subsequent) |
| Failure to reimburse expenses | PAGA + actual damages |

**PAGA reform (SB 92, 2024):** Employees must provide 65 days' notice to LWDA and employer before filing suit. Employers have an opportunity to cure certain violations within 33 days of notice. Work with legal counsel immediately upon receiving any PAGA notice.
