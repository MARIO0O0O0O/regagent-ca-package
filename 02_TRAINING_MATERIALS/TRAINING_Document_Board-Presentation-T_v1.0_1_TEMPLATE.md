## 🎚️ Policy Recommendations (5 minutes)

### Balanced Policy Approach

We recommend policies calibrated to:
- ✅ Exceed legal minimums
- ✅ Align with company culture (flexibility where appropriate)
- ✅ Protect against identified litigation risks
- ✅ Remain competitive with industry standards

### Policy Rigidity Analysis

| Policy Area | Current | Recommended | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Harassment Prevention | N/A | 9/10 (High) | Legal floor + high risk |
| Workplace Violence | N/A | 8/10 (High) | SB 553 + case law |
| Remote Work | Ad hoc | 5/10 (Moderate) | Culture fit + flexibility |
| Time Off | Adequate | 6/10 (Moderate) | SB 616 compliance |

**Key Insight:** Not all policies should be equally rigid. We calibrate based on legal risk, culture fit, and industry standards.
