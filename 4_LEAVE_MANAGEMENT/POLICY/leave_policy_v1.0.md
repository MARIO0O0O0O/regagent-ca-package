## 1. CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT (CFRA)

**Legal Authority:** Gov. Code § 12945.2 (expanded by SB 1383, eff. Jan. 1, 2021)  
**Enforcement:** California Civil Rights Department (CRD) | 1-800-884-1684 | www.calcivilrights.ca.gov

### Employer Coverage

CFRA applies to employers with **5 or more employees** anywhere in the state. The 2021 expansion from 50 to 5 employees dramatically extended CFRA's reach.

### Employee Eligibility

The employee must:
- Have worked for the employer at least **12 months** (need not be consecutive)
- Have worked at least **1,250 hours** in the 12 months immediately preceding the leave start date
- Work at a location where the employer has **5 or more employees** within 75 miles

### Qualifying Reasons for CFRA Leave

1. **Employee's own serious health condition** — inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider

2. **Care for a family member's serious health condition:**
   - Spouse or registered domestic partner
   - Child (biological, adopted, foster, step, legal ward, or *in loco parentis* — regardless of age or dependency)
   - Parent (biological, adoptive, step, or legal guardian; or parent of a spouse/domestic partner)
   - Grandparent
   - Grandchild
   - Sibling

3. **Baby bonding:** Birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child within 12 months of the qualifying event

4. **Qualifying military exigency:** Active duty of a spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent

> **Critical distinction:** CFRA excludes pregnancy-related disability from its definition of "serious health condition." Pregnancy disability is covered under PDL (Section 3). After PDL ends, the employee may then take CFRA leave for baby bonding.

### Duration

- **12 workweeks** per 12-month period
- The 12-month period is calculated using the [COMPANY METHOD: rolling backward / fixed calendar year / leave year anniversary]
- Leave may be taken continuously, intermittently, or on a reduced schedule when medically necessary
- **Bonding leave on reduced schedule** requires mutual employer-employee agreement

### Notice Requirements

- **Foreseeable leave:** 30 days' advance notice when possible; otherwise as soon as practicable
- **Unforeseeable leave:** Notify supervisor as soon as possible — same day or next business day
- **Medical certification:** May be required within 15 calendar days of the employer's request

### Designation

[COMPANY NAME] will designate leave as CFRA within **5 business days** of receiving sufficient information that the leave qualifies, or retroactively with written agreement of the employee.

---

## 2. FEDERAL FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA)

**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2601; 29 CFR Part 825  
**Enforcement:** U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division | 1-866-487-9243

FMLA applies when [COMPANY NAME] has **50 or more employees**. Where both CFRA and FMLA apply, CFRA provides the greater protections.

Key differences from CFRA:

| Feature | CFRA | FMLA |
|---------|------|------|
| Employer threshold | 5 employees | 50 employees |
| Pregnancy disability | NOT covered (PDL applies separately) | Covered as serious health condition |
| Domestic partner | Covered | NOT covered |
| Grandparent, grandchild, sibling | Covered | NOT covered |
| Key employee exception | Does NOT apply | Applies (salaried, top 10%) |

---

## 3. CFRA/FMLA CONCURRENCY RULES

When both CFRA and FMLA apply:

- **General rule:** CFRA and FMLA run concurrently — the employee draws down both simultaneously
- **Pregnancy exception:** PDL runs concurrent with FMLA (FMLA treats pregnancy as serious health condition), but PDL does NOT run concurrent with CFRA
- After PDL ends, CFRA bonding begins; remaining FMLA (if any) runs concurrent with CFRA bonding

**For employers with 5–49 employees:** Only CFRA applies; FMLA is not triggered. PDL and CFRA bonding are still sequential.

---

## 4. PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE (PDL)

**Legal Authority:** Gov. Code § 12945; 2 CCR §§ 11035–11051  
**Enforcement:** California Civil Rights Department | 1-800-884-1684

### Employer Coverage

5 or more employees. **No minimum service or hours requirement.** PDL is available from Day 1.

### Duration

Up to **4 months** (17 1/3 weeks based on the employee's regular work schedule) per pregnancy.

### Qualifying Conditions

Any period of actual disability caused by:
- Pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions
- Prenatal care and prenatal appointments
- Severe morning sickness
- Gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or eclampsia
- Postpartum recovery or postpartum depression
- Miscarriage or pregnancy loss
- Any other pregnancy-related condition certified by a healthcare provider

### Transfer Right

Before or during PDL, if the employee's position poses a health risk due to pregnancy, [COMPANY NAME] must temporarily transfer the employee to a less hazardous position — if available and medically advisable — upon request.

### Certification

A healthcare provider must certify the disability. The provider is not required to disclose the diagnosis — only that the employee is disabled due to a pregnancy-related condition and the approximate duration.

## 5. LEAVE CHAINING — PREGNANCY SCENARIO

The most complex leave interaction in California employment law.

### Chain A: Employer with 5–49 Employees (CFRA only)

**Phase 1 — PDL (up to 4 months, Day 1 eligible):**
Employee is disabled due to pregnancy or childbirth.

**Phase 2 — CFRA Bonding (12 weeks, begins when PDL ends):**
After PDL ends, the employee may immediately take CFRA leave for baby bonding.

**Total potential job-protected leave: up to approximately 7 months**

### Chain B: Employer with 50+ Employees (CFRA + FMLA)

**Phase 1 — PDL + concurrent FMLA:**
PDL (up to 4 months) runs concurrent with FMLA (12 weeks). After 12 weeks of FMLA is used, only PDL remains.

**Phase 2 — CFRA Bonding + any remaining FMLA:**
After PDL ends, CFRA bonding begins (12 weeks). If FMLA was not fully exhausted during PDL, the remaining FMLA weeks run concurrent with CFRA bonding.

**Example — Full PDL (17 weeks):**
- PDL: 17 weeks | FMLA: 12 weeks concurrent → FMLA exhausted in week 12 of PDL
- CFRA bonding: 12 weeks | No remaining FMLA
- Total: 17 + 12 = **29 weeks (approx. 7 months)**

**Example — Shorter PDL (6 weeks, e.g., uncomplicated C-section recovery):**
- PDL: 6 weeks | FMLA: 6 weeks concurrent → 6 weeks of FMLA remaining
- CFRA bonding: 12 weeks | Remaining FMLA (6 weeks) runs concurrent
- Total: 6 + 12 = **18 weeks**

### The Augmentation Principle — Sanchez v. Swissport (2013)

*Sanchez v. Swissport, Inc.* (Cal. App. 2013) held that PDL is intended to **augment, not supplant**, FEHA disability protections. Exhausting statutory leave does not automatically authorize termination.

**If the employee remains disabled after PDL/CFRA exhaustion:**
1. Engage in a timely, good-faith **interactive process**
2. Consider extended leave as a **reasonable accommodation**
3. Demonstrate undue hardship before denying the accommodation
4. Document every step

> Terminating an employee immediately upon leave exhaustion — without engaging in the interactive process — creates substantial FEHA liability.

## 6. REPRODUCTIVE LOSS LEAVE (SB 848)

**Legal Authority:** Labor Code §§ 12945.6–12945.7 (eff. January 1, 2024)  
**Enforcement:** California Civil Rights Department

### Who Qualifies

Employers with 5+ employees; employee must have at least **3 months of service**.

### Qualifying Events

- Failed adoption
- Failed surrogacy
- Miscarriage
- Stillbirth
- Unsuccessful assisted reproduction (IVF, egg/embryo transfer, etc.)

Both the **employee** and the employee's **spouse or domestic partner** who experiences a qualifying event are covered.

### Duration and Use

- **5 days** per qualifying event, taken within **3 months** of the event
- **Maximum:** 20 days per 12-month period if multiple events occur
- Days need not be taken consecutively

### Pay Status and Substitution

Leave is unpaid. Employee may use accrued PSL, vacation, or PTO consistent with company policy.

### Confidentiality

Reproductive loss leave records are treated as highly confidential medical information — stored in the confidential medical file, never in the main personnel file. The reason for leave need not be disclosed beyond what is necessary to administer the leave.

---

## 7. CALIFORNIA PAID SICK LEAVE (PSL)

**Legal Authority:** Labor Code § 246 (as amended); AB 406 (eff. Jan. 1, 2026)  
**Enforcement:** California Labor Commissioner / DLSE | 1-844-522-6734

### Accrual Method

[COMPANY NAME] uses the [ACCRUAL / FRONT-LOAD] method:
- **Accrual:** 1 hour per 30 hours worked, with a cap of [40/72] hours per year
- **OR Front-load:** 40 hours (5 days) provided at the start of each year

### Waiting Period

Employees begin accruing PSL from Day 1. They may **use** accrued PSL beginning on the **90th day** of employment.

### Permitted Uses

1. Preventive care, diagnosis, treatment of a health condition — employee or family member
2. Care for a family member (same scope as CFRA family member list)
3. Domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking — medical treatment, safety planning, legal proceedings
4. **Crime victim judicial proceedings (AB 406, effective January 1, 2026)** — attendance at judicial proceedings related to a crime of which the employee is a victim

### AB 406 — Crime Victim Expansion (2026)

Effective January 1, 2026, PSL may be used by employees who are crime victims to attend judicial proceedings. For employers with 25+ employees, Labor Code § 230(c) also provides additional unpaid leave protections for this purpose.

### Notice

Employees should provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable PSL use. Unforeseeable use: notify as soon as practicable. [COMPANY NAME] may not require employees to find coverage as a condition of PSL use.

## 8. STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE (SDI) AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE (PFL)

These are California **insurance programs** — not employer-granted leave. Funded by employee SDI payroll deductions. Administered by the Employment Development Department (EDD).

**EDD Contact:** 1-877-238-4373 | www.edd.ca.gov

### SDI — Employee's Own Disability

- Covers an employee's own disability including pregnancy-related disability
- **Benefit:** 60–70% of wages up to the weekly maximum
- **Duration:** Up to 52 weeks
- **Waiting period:** 7 days (first week unpaid)
- Coordinates with PDL (job protection) — SDI provides wage replacement; PDL provides the job protection

### PFL — Bonding and Family Care

- Covers baby bonding (birth, adoption, foster) and care for a seriously ill family member
- **Benefit:** 60–70% of wages up to the weekly maximum
- **Duration:** Up to **8 weeks** per year (SB 951, 2022)
- **No waiting period** for bonding claims
- Job protection during PFL bonding comes from CFRA — PFL alone does not protect the job

### SDI 2025 Update

As of January 1, 2025, the SDI taxable wage ceiling was removed, and benefit calculations were updated. Higher-wage employees may receive higher benefit amounts. Refer to current EDD rate tables.

### Integration with Employer-Paid Leave

[COMPANY NAME] may require employees to use accrued paid leave to supplement SDI/PFL benefits up to 100% of their regular weekly gross earnings.

- [COMPANY NAME] may require healthcare provider **fitness-for-duty certification** before return from PDL — this must be communicated to the employee when leave is designated

---

## 14. INTERACTIVE PROCESS — EXTENDED LEAVE AS ACCOMMODATION

When statutory leave is exhausted and the employee remains unable to return, FEHA requires [COMPANY NAME] to:

1. **Initiate the interactive process** in a timely manner — do not wait until the leave end date to begin
2. **Engage in good faith** — explore all potential accommodations, including extended leave
3. **Consider extended unpaid leave** as a reasonable accommodation unless it causes **undue hardship**
4. **Document everything** — dates, communications, options explored, decisions made

Undue hardship requires a fact-specific analysis. There is no blanket rule that a specific leave duration automatically creates undue hardship under California law.
