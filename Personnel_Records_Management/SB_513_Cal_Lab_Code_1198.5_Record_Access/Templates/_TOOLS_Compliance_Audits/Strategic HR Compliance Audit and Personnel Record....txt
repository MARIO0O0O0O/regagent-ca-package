Physical Standards (Vault)
* Vault Rating: Vital paper records should be stored in fire-resistive enclosures rated UL 72 Class 350 for paper (maintaining <350°F internally).[23, 24, 25]
* Environmental Control: Vaults must maintain a stable environment (~70°F and 30-50% humidity) to prevent the degradation of paper assets.[26]
3. Statutory Snippets & Requirements for Compliance
A. Personnel File Definition (SB 513)
"Existing law grants... the right to inspect... personnel records... SB 513 clarifies that personnel records relating to the employee's performance now also include education and training records... [including] skills in equipment or software." [27, 2]
B. Workplace Know Your Rights (SB 294)
"On or before February 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, [employers must] provide a stand-alone written notice to each current employee of specified workers' rights... [and] offer all current employees... an opportunity to designate an emergency contact." [4, 28, 29]
C. Medical Privacy (CMIA)
"Each employer who receives medical information shall establish appropriate procedures to ensure the confidentiality and protection from unauthorized use and disclosure of that information." [30, 31]
4. Analytical Placeholders
(Placeholder for conducting analysis on upcoming California Supreme Court rulings regarding "shadow files" maintained by managers outside of central HR systems and the definition of "actual knowledge" in arrest notifications under SB 294.)
(Placeholder for determining organizational risk appetite regarding document scanning. Analysis will seek to balance the ease of digital retrieval with the high overhead of maintaining a physical UL-rated vault room.)
