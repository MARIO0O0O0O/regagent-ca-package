# **ARTIFACT 7: CALIFORNIA LEAVE LAWS FOR MID-TO-LARGE EMPLOYERS (50-100+ EMPLOYEES) - EXTENSION TO ARTIFACT 6**


## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**


**Purpose of This Document:**
This artifact is a **supplement to Artifact 6** (California Leave Laws for Small Employers). Employers with 50 or more employees must comply with **ALL requirements in Artifact 6**, PLUS the additional federal and state requirements outlined in this document.


**Critical Threshold:** **50+ Employees**


**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Primary Additional Mandates:** Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) - 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.; New Parent Leave Act (20-49 employees) - Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.6


**Key Compliance Addition at 50+ Employees:**
- **Federal FMLA** now applies (in addition to California CFRA)
- **Dual compliance** required: Must satisfy both federal and state law
- **Strategic leave administration:** Determine when leaves run concurrently vs. consecutively
- **Military caregiver leave:** 26 weeks (federal only, not state)
- **More complex recordkeeping** and notice requirements


**2026 Critical Compliance Strategy:**
Employers at the 50+ threshold face the most complex leave administration landscape in California employment law. The interaction between federal FMLA and California CFRA/PDL creates scenarios where employees may be entitled to **over 7 months of job-protected leave** for a single qualifying event (childbirth). Proper designation and tracking is essential to avoid inadvertent violations.

## **SECTION 1: FEDERAL FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) - 50+ EMPLOYEES**


### **1.1 Applicability and Coverage**


**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2611, 29 CFR § 825.104


**Federal Employer Coverage Threshold:**


**[ ] 50 Employees Within 75-Mile Radius**


Unlike California CFRA (which counts employees company-wide), FMLA requires:
- **50 or more employees** for **each working day** during each of **20 or more calendar workweeks** in the current or preceding calendar year
- Employees must work within a **75-mile radius** of the worksite where leave is requested


**Critical Distinction:**
```
CFRA (California): 
- 5+ employees TOTAL (all locations)
- No geographic limitation


FMLA (Federal):
- 50+ employees within 75-mile radius of employee's worksite
- Measured during 20+ workweeks in current/prior year
```


**Employee Counting Rules:**


**[ ] Who Counts Toward 50:**
- Employees on payroll (even if not actively working)
- Employees on leave (paid or unpaid)
- Part-time employees (count as employed on days they work)
- Joint employees (count for both employers if economically dependent on both)


**[ ] Who Does NOT Count:**
- Independent contractors
- Employees who terminated before count date
- Employees working outside 75-mile radius


**[ ] 75-Mile Radius Calculation:**


Measured by **surface miles** using surface transportation over public streets, roads, highways, and waterways.


**Example:**
```
Company Locations:
- Main Office (Los Angeles): 80 employees
- Branch Office (San Diego - 120 miles away): 30 employees
- Remote Office (San Francisco - 380 miles away): 25 employees


FMLA Analysis:
Main Office employees: ELIGIBLE (80 employees within 75 miles)
San Diego employees: NOT ELIGIBLE (only 30 within 75 miles)
San Francisco employees: NOT ELIGIBLE (only 25 within 75 miles)


CFRA Analysis:
ALL employees: ELIGIBLE (135 total employees company-wide exceeds 5-employee threshold)


Result: San Diego and San Francisco employees get CFRA (California) but NOT FMLA (federal)
```


### **1.2 Employee Eligibility Requirements**


**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2611(2); 29 CFR § 825.110


**[ ] Three-Part Eligibility Test (All Must Be Met):**


**1. 12 Months of Service**
- Employee must have worked for employer for **at least 12 months**
- Need not be consecutive (breaks in service may count if within 7 years)
- Includes time on unpaid leave (e.g., prior FMLA/CFRA leave)


**2. 1,250 Hours Worked in Prior 12 Months**
- Measured by looking back 12 months from date leave begins
- Only **hours actually worked** count (not paid leave time, holidays, etc.)
- Calculation: 1,250 ÷ 12 = ~104 hours/month average


**3. Worksite Has 50+ Employees Within 75 Miles**
- See Section 1.1 above


**Critical Comparison to CFRA:**


| Requirement | FMLA (Federal) | CFRA (California) |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Employer Size** | 50+ within 75 miles | 5+ company-wide |
| **Service Time** | 12 months | 12 months |
| **Hours Worked** | 1,250 in prior 12 months | 1,250 in prior 12 months |
| **Geographic Limit** | 75-mile radius | None |


**Result:** CFRA eligibility requirements are **MORE GENEROUS** (easier to qualify) than FMLA due to lower employer threshold and no geographic limitation.


### **1.3 Leave Entitlement and Duration**


**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a); 29 CFR § 825.200


**[ ] Basic Leave Entitlement:**


**12 workweeks** of unpaid, job-protected leave in a **12-month period** for:
1. Birth of child and to care for newborn (within 1 year of birth)
2. Placement of child for adoption or foster care (within 1 year)
3. Care for spouse, child, or parent with serious health condition
4. Employee's own serious health condition
5. Qualifying exigency related to covered military service


**PLUS:**


**26 workweeks** (in a single 12-month period) for:
6. Military caregiver leave (care for covered servicemember)


**"Workweek" Calculation:**


For employee with **normal work schedule:**
```
Full-time (40 hrs/week): 12 workweeks = 480 hours
Part-time (20 hrs/week): 12 workweeks = 240 hours
Variable schedule: Average hours/week over prior 12 months
```


**[ ] 12-Month Period Calculation Methods:**


Employer must choose **ONE** method and apply consistently:


**Method 1: Calendar Year (Jan 1 - Dec 31)**
- Simple to administer
- Risk: "Stacking" (12 weeks in Dec + 12 weeks in Jan = 24 consecutive weeks)


**Method 2: Fixed Year (e.g., Fiscal Year)**
- Similar to calendar year
- Same stacking risk


**Method 3: 12-Month Period from First FMLA Leave**
- Measured forward from date first FMLA leave begins
- Prevents stacking
- Individualized tracking


**Method 4: Rolling 12-Month Backward** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Measured backward from date leave is requested
- Look back 12 months: How much FMLA was used?
- Prevents stacking
- Most protective for employer


**Example - Rolling Backward:**
```
Employee requests FMLA leave on March 1, 2026


Look back 12 months: March 1, 2025 - February 29, 2026
FMLA used during lookback period: 4 weeks (January 2026)


Available FMLA: 12 weeks - 4 weeks = 8 weeks remaining
```


**Best Practice:** Use **same 12-month calculation method** for both FMLA and CFRA to avoid confusion.


### **1.4 Qualifying Reasons - FMLA vs. CFRA Comparison**


**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a); Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.2(c)(3)(B); 29 CFR § 825.112; 2 CCR § 11087


**[ ] Side-by-Side Comparison:**


| Reason for Leave | FMLA (Federal) | CFRA (California) |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Baby Bonding - Birth** | ✅ Yes (within 1 year) | ✅ Yes (within 1 year) |
| **Baby Bonding - Adoption/Foster** | ✅ Yes (within 1 year) | ✅ Yes (within 1 year) |
| **Employee's Own Serious Health Condition** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Care for Spouse** | ✅ Yes (serious health condition) | ✅ Yes (serious health condition) |
| **Care for Child** | ✅ Yes (serious health condition) | ✅ Yes (serious health condition, any age) |
| **Care for Parent** | ✅ Yes (biological/adoptive/in loco parentis ONLY) | ✅ Yes (includes parent-in-law, stepparent) |
| **Care for Parent-in-Law** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| **Care for Grandparent** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| **Care for Grandchild** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| **Care for Sibling** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| **Care for "Designated Person"** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES (2026 expansion) |
| **Military Exigency (Active Duty)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Military Caregiver (26 weeks)** | ✅ YES (26 weeks) | ❌ NO (only 12 weeks under CFRA) |


**Critical Takeaways:**


**1. CFRA Covers MORE Family Relationships:**
California's definition of "family member" is **broader** than federal FMLA. This creates strategic opportunities for employees to preserve FMLA for other uses.


**Example:**
```
Employee needs to care for sick grandmother (serious health condition)


FMLA: Does NOT cover grandparent care → FMLA bank untouched
CFRA: DOES cover grandparent care → Use CFRA only


Result: Employee uses 12 weeks CFRA for grandmother, preserves 12 weeks FMLA for potential future use (e.g., employee's own health issue)


Employer Strategy: Designate leave as "CFRA only" (not FMLA)
```


**2. Military Caregiver Leave - FMLA Only:**
FMLA provides up to **26 workweeks** (not 12) to care for covered servicemember. CFRA does **NOT** have this extended benefit.


**Covered Servicemember:**
- Current member of Armed Forces with serious injury/illness incurred in line of duty
- Veteran who was discharged within 5 years and has serious injury/illness incurred in line of duty


**Who Can Take Military Caregiver Leave:**
- Spouse
- Son/daughter
- Parent
- Next of kin


**Single 12-Month Period:**
Unlike regular FMLA (which renews annually), military caregiver leave is measured in a **single 12-month period** starting on first day of leave.


**Example:**
```
Employee takes military caregiver leave starting June 1, 2026


26-Week Entitlement: June 1, 2026 - May 31, 2027 (single period)


If employee uses 10 weeks in 2026 and 16 weeks in early 2027 = 26 weeks total


Once 26 weeks exhausted, no additional military caregiver leave until new qualifying event (different servicemember or new injury)
```


**Combined FMLA Limitation:**
If employee takes **both** regular FMLA (12 weeks) and military caregiver FMLA (26 weeks) in same 12-month period, combined total **cannot exceed 26 weeks**.


**Example:**
```
Single 12-Month Period (June 1, 2026 - May 31, 2027):


Employee takes:
- 8 weeks FMLA for own serious health condition (July 2026)
- 26 weeks military caregiver leave for injured spouse (Aug 2026 - Jan 2027)


PROBLEM: 8 + 26 = 34 weeks > 26-week cap


SOLUTION: Maximum leave available = 26 weeks total
- Employee can take full 26 weeks for military caregiver, OR
- Employee can take 8 weeks for own health + 18 weeks military caregiver (total = 26)
```


### **1.5 Serious Health Condition - FMLA Definition**


**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11); 29 CFR § 825.113


**[ ] FMLA "Serious Health Condition" Defined:**


An illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:
1. **Inpatient care**, OR
2. **Continuing treatment by a health care provider**


**1.5.A Inpatient Care**


**Definition:**
Overnight stay in hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility.


**Includes:**
- Any period of incapacity (inability to work, attend school, perform regular activities)
- Any subsequent treatment connected to the inpatient care


**Example:**
```
Employee hospitalized overnight for appendectomy


Day 1: Surgery and overnight hospital stay → QUALIFIES (inpatient care)
Days 2-7: Home recovery → COVERED (subsequent treatment/incapacity)


Total FMLA Leave: 7 days (or longer if medically necessary)
```


**1.5.B Continuing Treatment - Five Categories**


**Category 1: Period of Incapacity Requiring Absence of More Than 3 Days + Treatment**


**Requirements (ALL must be met):**
- Period of incapacity of **more than 3 consecutive full calendar days**, AND
- Treatment by health care provider **2 or more times** within 30 days of first day of incapacity, OR
- Treatment by health care provider **1 time** within 7 days of first day of incapacity + continuing regimen of treatment (e.g., prescription medication, physical therapy)


**Example - QUALIFIES:**
```
Employee has severe flu:
Day 1-5: Unable to work (5 days incapacity) ✓
Day 2: Visits doctor, receives prescription ✓
Day 4: Follow-up visit to doctor ✓


Result: QUALIFIES (>3 days + 2 treatments within 30 days)
```


**Example - DOES NOT QUALIFY:**
```
Employee has cold:
Day 1-4: Calls in sick (4 days absence)
Day 5: Visits urgent care, no follow-up


Result: DOES NOT QUALIFY (only 1 treatment, no continuing regimen)
```


**Category 2: Pregnancy or Prenatal Care**


**Any period of incapacity due to:**
- Pregnancy (including severe morning sickness, bed rest)
- Prenatal care


**Example:**
```
Pregnant employee has severe morning sickness:
Unable to work for 2 days → QUALIFIES (pregnancy-related)


Employee attends routine prenatal appointment:
Takes 2 hours off for checkup → QUALIFIES (prenatal care)
```


**Note:** Pregnancy disabilities also covered by California PDL (see Artifact 6, Section 3).


**Category 3: Chronic Serious Health Condition**


**Requirements (ALL must be met):**
- Condition requires periodic visits (at least **2 times per year**) to health care provider
- Continues over extended period of time
- May cause episodic periods of incapacity (e.g., flare-ups)


**Examples:**
- Asthma (with periodic flare-ups requiring treatment)
- Diabetes (requiring regular monitoring and treatment)
- Epilepsy (with periodic seizures)
- Migraine headaches (severe, recurring)
- Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD with regular treatment)


**Example:**
```
Employee has Type 1 diabetes:
- Sees endocrinologist every 3 months (4 times/year) ✓
- Condition is lifelong ✓
- Occasionally needs time off when blood sugar dangerously high ✓


Result: QUALIFIES as chronic serious health condition


Employee can take FMLA for:
- Scheduled doctor appointments
- Episodic flare-ups (high/low blood sugar events)
- Diabetes-related complications
```


**Category 4: Permanent or Long-Term Conditions Requiring Supervision**


**Requirements:**
- Condition is permanent or long-term
- Requires continuing supervision by health care provider
- May not respond to active treatment


**Examples:**
- Alzheimer's disease
- Severe stroke resulting in permanent disability
- Terminal illnesses (cancer in final stages)


**Category 5: Multiple Treatments**


**For restorative surgery after accident/injury, OR**
**For condition that would result in incapacity of more than 3 days if not treated**


**Examples:**
- Chemotherapy for cancer
- Radiation therapy
- Physical therapy following serious injury
- Dialysis for kidney disease
- Treatment for substance abuse (in residential treatment program or continuing supervised outpatient treatment)


**Example:**
```
Employee diagnosed with breast cancer:
- Requires 8 rounds of chemotherapy (1 every 3 weeks)
- Each treatment requires 1 day off + 1-2 days recovery


Total FMLA: 8 treatments × 3 days = 24 days (distributed over 6 months)


Qualifies as: Multiple treatments for serious condition
```


**1.5.C What Does NOT Qualify as Serious Health Condition**


**Common Non-Qualifying Conditions:**
- ❌ Common cold (even if absent 3+ days, unless develops into serious complication)
- ❌ Flu (unless requires hospitalization or meets continuing treatment test)
- ❌ Earaches (unless severe infection requiring multiple treatments)
- ❌ Upset stomach (unless severe requiring medical treatment)
- ❌ Minor ulcers (unless recurring and requiring regular treatment)
- ❌ Headaches (unless migraines meeting chronic serious condition test)
- ❌ Routine dental/orthodontia work (unless restorative surgery after accident)
- ❌ Cosmetic treatments (unless resulting from accident/injury)


**Critical Distinction:**
Absence of **3 full consecutive calendar days** is often required. Taking off Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday = 3 days. But taking off Friday, Monday (with weekend in between) = only 1 day for FMLA purposes.

## **SECTION 2: FMLA VS. CFRA - STRATEGIC LEAVE DESIGNATION**


### **2.1 Concurrent vs. Sequential Leave Administration**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.702(d); 2 CCR § 11090


**Critical Employer Decision:**
When employee qualifies for **BOTH** FMLA and CFRA, employer must determine whether leaves run:
- **CONCURRENTLY** (same time counts toward both entitlements), OR
- **SEQUENTIALLY** (separate time for each)


**2.1.A When Leaves Run Concurrently (Same Time Counts Toward Both)**


**Scenario 1: Employee's Own Serious Health Condition**


If condition qualifies under **both** FMLA and CFRA definitions:
- ✅ Run concurrently
- Same 12 weeks counts toward both FMLA and CFRA


**Example:**
```
Employee has heart attack, requires 8 weeks off for recovery


FMLA: Qualifies (serious health condition - inpatient care)
CFRA: Qualifies (serious health condition)


Designation: "FMLA and CFRA - Concurrent"


Leave Usage:
FMLA: 8 weeks used, 4 weeks remaining
CFRA: 8 weeks used, 4 weeks remaining


Employee returns after 8 weeks with 4 weeks of combined FMLA/CFRA remaining
```


**Scenario 2: Baby Bonding Leave (Non-Birthing Parent)**


Non-birthing parent (father, partner, adoptive parent) taking leave to bond with new child:
- ✅ Run concurrently
- FMLA and CFRA both cover baby bonding


**Example:**
```
Father takes 12 weeks off after birth of child


FMLA: Qualifies (birth and care for newborn)
CFRA: Qualifies (baby bonding)


Designation: "FMLA and CFRA - Concurrent"


Leave Usage:
FMLA: 12 weeks used, 0 remaining
CFRA: 12 weeks used, 0 remaining


Total Leave Taken: 12 weeks (counts toward both)
```


**2.1.B When Leaves Run Sequentially (Separate Entitlements)**


**Scenario 1: Pregnancy Disability (PDL) → CFRA Baby Bonding**


**For birthing parent (mother):**
- PDL runs FIRST (disability due to pregnancy/childbirth)
- CFRA baby bonding runs AFTER PDL ends
- FMLA runs concurrently with CFRA baby bonding (NOT with PDL)


**Critical Rule:** **PDL and FMLA do NOT run together. PDL and CFRA do NOT run together for childbirth.**


**Timeline:**
```
PHASE 1: PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE (PDL)
Duration: Up to 4 months (typically 6-8 weeks postpartum)
Covered by: PDL only (not FMLA, not CFRA)
Reason: Disability due to childbirth


PHASE 2: BABY BONDING (CFRA)
Duration: 12 weeks
Covered by: CFRA + FMLA concurrently
Reason: Bonding with newborn


TOTAL LEAVE: Up to ~7 months (4 months PDL + 12 weeks CFRA/FMLA)
```


**Example:**
```
Mother gives birth: March 1, 2026


PDL Period:
Start: March 1, 2026
Doctor certifies disability: 8 weeks (until April 26, 2026)
End: April 26, 2026


Leave Balances After PDL:
PDL: 8 weeks used (from 4-month entitlement)
CFRA: 0 weeks used (CFRA not yet triggered)
FMLA: 0 weeks used (FMLA not yet triggered)


CFRA Baby Bonding Period:
Start: April 27, 2026 (day after PDL ends)
Duration: 12 weeks
End: July 19, 2026


Leave Balances After CFRA:
PDL: 8 weeks used (completed)
CFRA: 12 weeks used (exhausted)
FMLA: 12 weeks used (ran concurrently with CFRA, exhausted)


Return to Work: July 20, 2026


Total Leave Taken: ~4.5 months
```


**Scenario 2: Care for Family Member (CFRA-Only Relationship)**


If employee needs to care for family member who qualifies under **CFRA but NOT FMLA** (e.g., grandparent, parent-in-law, sibling):
- CFRA runs by itself
- FMLA bank preserved for future use


**Example:**
```
Employee needs to care for sick grandmother (serious health condition)


FMLA: Does NOT cover grandparent → Not FMLA-qualifying
CFRA: Covers grandparent → CFRA-qualifying


Designation: "CFRA only" (not FMLA)


Employee takes 10 weeks to care for grandmother


Leave Usage:
CFRA: 10 weeks used, 2 weeks remaining
FMLA: 0 weeks used, 12 weeks remaining (preserved)


Later in year: Employee has own health emergency


Can still use: 12 weeks FMLA + 2 weeks remaining CFRA
```


**2.1.C Leave Designation Decision Matrix**


| Reason for Leave | FMLA? | CFRA? | Run Concurrently? |
|------------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Employee's own serious health condition | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES - concurrent |
| Pregnancy disability (birthing parent) | No | No (PDL applies) | N/A - PDL separate |
| Baby bonding after PDL (birthing parent) | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES - concurrent |
| Baby bonding (non-birthing parent) | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES - concurrent |
| Care for spouse (serious health condition) | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES - concurrent |
| Care for child (serious health condition) | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES - concurrent |
| Care for parent (biological/adoptive) | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES - concurrent |
| Care for parent-in-law | No | Yes | ❌ NO - CFRA only |
| Care for grandparent | No | Yes | ❌ NO - CFRA only |
| Care for grandchild | No | Yes | ❌ NO - CFRA only |
| Care for sibling | No | Yes | ❌ NO - CFRA only |
| Care for "designated person" | No | Yes | ❌ NO - CFRA only |
| Military exigency | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES - concurrent |
| Military caregiver (26 weeks) | Yes | No | ❌ NO - FMLA only |


**2.1.D Employer Designation Best Practices**


**[ ] ALWAYS Designate Leave as Both FMLA and CFRA When Both Apply:**


**Why:** Running leaves concurrently protects employer from extended leave exposure.


**Example:**
```
CORRECT DESIGNATION:
"Your leave for [reason] has been designated as FMLA and CFRA leave, 
running concurrently. This leave will count toward your 12-week 
entitlement under both federal FMLA and California CFRA."


INCORRECT (Creates Risk):
"Your leave is approved" 
[Fails to designate as FMLA/CFRA → Employee may later claim leave 
doesn't count, demand separate 12 weeks FMLA + 12 weeks CFRA]
```


**[ ] Issue Written Designation Notice Within 5 Business Days:**


Template in Section 2.8.B (Artifact 6) - modify to include both FMLA and CFRA designation.


**[ ] Track Both Entitlements Separately (Even if Running Concurrently):**


Maintain records showing:
- FMLA balance: X weeks used, Y weeks remaining
- CFRA balance: X weeks used, Y weeks remaining
- Whether concurrent or sequential


**Benefit:** If employee later claims FMLA was not properly designated, you can demonstrate compliance.

## **SECTION 3: FEDERAL FMLA NOTICE REQUIREMENTS**


### **3.1 Three Types of FMLA Notices**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.300


Employers must provide **THREE** separate written notices under federal FMLA (in addition to California CFRA notices):


1. **General Notice (Posting)**
2. **Eligibility Notice**
3. **Rights and Responsibilities Notice**
4. **Designation Notice**


**Note:** California CFRA also requires eligibility and designation notices (see Artifact 6, Section 2.8). **Best practice:** Create combined FMLA/CFRA notices that satisfy both federal and state requirements.


### **3.2 General Notice - FMLA Workplace Poster**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.300(a)


**[ ] Mandatory Workplace Posting:**


Employer must post notice explaining FMLA provisions where employees can readily see it.


**Required Poster:** U.S. Department of Labor Form **WH-1420**


**Download:** https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/posters


**Posting Locations:**
- Employee break rooms
- Time clock areas
- HR office
- Any location where required notices are customarily posted


**Language Requirements:**
- English (always required)
- Spanish (if significant portion of workforce Spanish-speaking)


**Penalties for Non-Posting:**
- Civil money penalty up to **$233 per violation** (2026 amount, adjusted annually)


**Electronic Posting:**
For employees who work remotely or access HR materials electronically, post FMLA notice on company intranet or employee portal.


### **3.3 Eligibility Notice**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.300(b)


**[ ] Timing:** Within **5 business days** of learning employee's need for FMLA leave (or employee requesting FMLA information)


**[ ] Required Content:**


Must inform employee whether they are **eligible** for FMLA leave:
- If eligible: State eligibility
- If not eligible: State at least one reason for ineligibility (e.g., "You have not worked 1,250 hours in the past 12 months")


**[ ] DOL Form:** **WH-381** (Eligibility Notice)


**Download:** https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/forms


**Best Practice:** Combine with California CFRA eligibility notice in single document.


**Combined FMLA/CFRA Eligibility Notice Template:**
```
[COMPANY NAME]
FMLA/CFRA ELIGIBILITY NOTICE
(Federal Family and Medical Leave Act & California Family Rights Act)


To: [Employee Name]
Date: __________
Re: Leave Request for [Reason]


We received your request for leave beginning __________.


--- ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION ---

- Employer provides written notice to employee of retroactive designation
- Employer had information to designate leave as FMLA initially


**BUT:** Cannot unfairly surprise employee. If employee believed leave was NOT FMLA and had relied on that belief, retroactive designation may be challenged.

**Note:** Employers **may** use DOL forms OR create custom forms, but custom forms cannot request more information than DOL forms request.


### **4.2 Certification Timing and Deadlines**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.305(b)


**[ ] Employee's Deadline to Provide Certification:**


**15 calendar days** from date employer requests certification (or as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances)


**Counting Days:**
- Start: Day employer provides blank certification form to employee
- End: Day 15 (calendar days, not business days)
- Weekends and holidays count


**Example:**
```
Employer provides WH-380-E form to employee: Monday, March 3, 2026
Employee's deadline: Monday, March 18, 2026 (15 calendar days later)


If employee unable to get doctor's appointment by March 18:
Employee should notify employer and request extension
Employer may grant reasonable extension
```


**[ ] If Certification is Incomplete or Insufficient:**


Employer must provide employee with **written notice** of deficiency and allow **7 calendar days** to cure.


**Cure Period Process:**
1. Employer reviews certification
2. If incomplete/insufficient, send written notice specifying exactly what is missing
3. Employee has 7 calendar days from receipt of notice to cure deficiency
4. Employee may have healthcare provider correct or supplement certification


**Example:**
```
Employee returns WH-380-E with following deficiencies:
- Missing dates of treatment
- Healthcare provider didn't sign form
- No statement whether employee unable to perform job functions


Employer sends cure notice: March 20, 2026
"Your medical certification is incomplete. Please have your healthcare 
provider complete the following within 7 days:
1. Provide dates of treatment (Question 5)
2. Sign and date the form (Question 8)
3. Certify whether you are unable to perform job functions (Question 6)"


Employee deadline to cure: March 27, 2026
```


**[ ] Consequences of Failure to Provide Certification:**


If employee **fails to provide sufficient certification** after being given opportunity to cure:


Employer **may**:
- Delay designation of leave as FMLA (leave not protected)
- Deny leave request entirely
- Discipline employee for excessive absences (if absences not protected)


Employer **must**:
- Notify employee in writing that leave is not FMLA-protected due to insufficient certification
- Provide employee another opportunity to cure if employee provides reasonable explanation for delay


### **4.3 Second and Third Opinions**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.307


**[ ] When Employer May Require Second Opinion:**


If employer has reason to doubt validity of medical certification, employer may require employee to obtain **second opinion** from healthcare provider designated by employer.


**Employer Responsibilities:**
- Employer pays for second opinion
- Employer selects healthcare provider (cannot be provider employed on regular basis by employer)
- Second opinion provider may not be familiar with employee's history


**[ ] If First and Second Opinions Conflict:**


Employer may require **third opinion** from healthcare provider jointly approved by employer and employee.


**Third Opinion is FINAL and BINDING** on both parties.


**Employer pays** for third opinion.


**Example:**
```
Step 1: Employee provides certification from Dr. Smith stating employee 
unable to work for 8 weeks due to back injury


Step 2: Employer doubts certification (suspects exaggeration)
Employer requires second opinion from Dr. Jones (employer pays)


Step 3: Dr. Jones certifies employee can return to work in 2 weeks


Step 4: Conflict between first opinion (8 weeks) and second opinion (2 weeks)
Employer and employee jointly select Dr. Lee for third opinion


Step 5: Dr. Lee certifies employee needs 4 weeks off


Step 6: Third opinion is FINAL → Employee gets 4 weeks FMLA leave
```


**[ ] Limitations on Second/Third Opinions:**


Employer **cannot** require second/third opinions for:
- Recertifications (unless specific reasonable doubt exists)
- Every FMLA request (only when legitimate doubt about validity)


**Prohibited Practices:**
- ❌ Routinely requiring second opinions for all certifications
- ❌ Requiring second opinion from specific healthcare provider who always denies leave
- ❌ Delaying leave while waiting for second opinion (if employee provided timely first certification, leave must begin)


### **4.4 Recertification**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.308


**[ ] When Employer May Request Recertification:**


Employer may request new medical certification:


**No More Frequently Than Every 30 Days** AND only if:
- Employee requests leave extension
- Circumstances described in original certification changed significantly (duration, frequency, severity)
- Employer receives information casting doubt on employee's stated reason for absence


**EXCEPTION - More Frequent Recertification Allowed:**
- If minimum duration of condition specified in original certification expires (e.g., "Employee will be incapacitated for 2 weeks" → After 2 weeks, employer can request recert for extension)
- For chronic/lifelong conditions with episodic flare-ups: Every 6 months (not every 30 days)


**Example:**
```
Employee has chronic condition (diabetes) requiring intermittent leave 
for periodic flare-ups


Original Certification: January 15, 2026
States: "Employee may need intermittent leave for diabetes-related 
issues. Condition is ongoing and permanent."


Employer may request recertification:
• July 15, 2026 (6 months later) - earliest permissible for chronic condition
• NOT every 30 days (too frequent for chronic condition)
```


**[ ] Recertification Form:**


Employer may require same level of information as initial certification, but:
- Cannot request new information beyond scope of original certification
- Employee is NOT required to see healthcare provider again if provider can recertify based on existing records
- If condition changed, employee may need new appointment

## **SECTION 5: JOB RESTORATION AND KEY EMPLOYEE EXCEPTION**


### **5.1 Job Restoration Rights - FMLA**


**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a); 29 CFR § 825.214


**[ ] Restoration to Same or Equivalent Position:**


Employee returning from FMLA leave entitled to:
- **Same position** held when leave began, OR
- **Equivalent position** with equivalent:
  - Pay (salary/hourly rate)
  - Benefits (health insurance, retirement, paid leave accrual)
  - Terms and conditions of employment
  - Working conditions (shift, schedule, location)
  - Privileges of employment (seniority, opportunity for advancement, access to training)


**Critical Rule:** "Equivalent position" does NOT mean **identical position.** Employer may make changes as long as position is substantially equal.


**Permitted Changes:**
- ✅ Different supervisor
- ✅ Different office/workspace (if same location/commute distance)
- ✅ Different job title (if duties substantially equivalent)
- ✅ Reorganization that would have occurred regardless of leave


**Prohibited Changes:**
- ❌ Reduced pay
- ❌ Reduced benefits
- ❌ Less desirable shift (day shift → night shift)
- ❌ Significant increase in commute distance
- ❌ Reduction in job duties or responsibilities
- ❌ Demotion


**Example - COMPLIANT:**
```
Before Leave:
Position: Senior Accountant
Salary: $85,000/year
Supervisor: Jane Smith, Controller
Location: Main office, Building A, 3rd floor, Cube 305
Benefits: Health insurance, 401(k) match, 3 weeks vacation


Upon Return:
Position: Senior Financial Analyst [different title]
Salary: $85,000/year [same pay]
Supervisor: Bob Johnson, CFO [different supervisor]
Location: Main office, Building B, 2nd floor, Cube 210 [different location, same facility]
Benefits: Health insurance, 401(k) match, 3 weeks vacation [same benefits]
Duties: Financial analysis and reporting [substantially similar]


RESULT: Equivalent position - COMPLIANT
```


**Example - NON-COMPLIANT:**
```
Before Leave:
Position: Marketing Manager
Salary: $95,000/year
Shift: 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM (day shift)


Upon Return:
Position: Marketing Coordinator [demotion]
Salary: $70,000/year [25% pay cut]
Shift: 3:00 PM - 11:00 PM (evening shift)


RESULT: Not equivalent position - VIOLATION
Employee entitled to damages + reinstatement to Marketing Manager
```


### **5.2 Bonus, Perfect Attendance, and Performance Evaluations**


**Legal Authority:** 29 CFR § 825.215


**[ ] Bonuses Based on Achieving Production Goals:**


If employee would have received bonus if they had worked instead of taking FMLA leave, employer **must** pay bonus upon return.


**Example:**
```
Company pays quarterly production bonus to employees who process 500+ claims


Employee took 4 weeks FMLA leave during quarter
Employee processed 450 claims while actively working
If employee had worked full quarter (no leave), would have processed 550+ claims


RESULT: Employer must pay bonus (or prorated portion if methodology permits proration)
```


**[ ] Bonuses for Perfect Attendance:**


Employer **cannot** deny perfect attendance bonus solely because employee took FMLA leave.


**Prohibited:**
```
POLICY: "Employees with perfect attendance (no absences) receive $500 bonus"


Employee takes 3 weeks FMLA leave for surgery
Employer denies $500 bonus due to FMLA absence


RESULT: VIOLATION - Cannot count FMLA leave as absence for attendance bonus
```


**Permitted:**
```
POLICY: "Employees receive attendance bonus based on days worked"
Proration: ($500 / 260 workdays) × Days Actually Worked


Employee worked 220 days (40 days FMLA leave)
Bonus: ($500 / 260) × 220 = $423


RESULT: COMPLIANT - Proration based on actual work, not penalty for FMLA
```


**[ ] Performance Evaluations:**


Employer **must** evaluate employee on same basis as if employee had not taken FMLA leave.


**Permitted:**
- Evaluating employee based on actual work performed
- Noting that evaluation covers partial period due to leave


**Prohibited:**
- Counting FMLA leave as negative factor
- Reducing performance rating because employee "wasn't available" due to FMLA leave
- Denying raise/promotion because employee took FMLA leave


### **5.3 "Key Employee" Exception - FMLA Only**


**Legal Authority:** 29 U.S.C. § 2614(b); 29 CFR § 825.217


**Critical Limitation:** This exception applies **ONLY to FMLA (federal law).** California CFRA does **NOT** have a "key employee" exception.


**[ ] "Key Employee" Defined:**


**Salaried** eligible employee who is among the **highest paid 10%** of all employees within **75 miles** of worksite.


**Calculation:**
1. Identify all employees within 75-mile radius
2. Rank by annual compensation (salary + bonuses + commissions)
3. Top 10% = "key employees"


**Example:**
```
Employer has 200 employees within 75-mile radius
Top 10%: 20 employees


Top 20 highest-paid employees = "key employees"


If employee's salary ranks in top 20: KEY EMPLOYEE
If employee's salary ranks #21 or below: NOT a key employee
```


**[ ] When Employer May Deny Restoration to Key Employee:**


Employer may **deny restoration** to key employee **ONLY IF:**
- Restoration would cause **"substantial and grievous economic injury"** to employer's operations, AND
- Employer notifies employee of intent to deny restoration, AND
- Employee chooses not to return after notification, OR
- Employee fails to return despite notification


**"Substantial and Grievous Economic Injury" Test:**


Extremely high bar. Must show:
- Significant, material economic harm (not merely inconvenient or costly)
- Harm affects company's ability to operate
- No other alternative available (e.g., can't hire temporary replacement or reorganize duties)


**Examples Likely Meeting Test:**
- Small company where key employee is only person with critical expertise
- Key employee's departure would cause loss of major client representing 40%+ of revenue
- Replacement has been hired on permanent basis and terminating replacement would create severe financial harm


**Examples NOT Meeting Test:**
- General inconvenience or cost of holding position
- Need to pay overtime to cover key employee's work
- Disruption to workflow or morale
- Cost of training replacement


**[ ] Notice Requirements for Key Employee:**


**Step 1:** When employee requests FMLA leave (or employer becomes aware of need), employer must notify employee in writing of "key employee" status.


**Step 2:** If, during leave, employer determines restoration would cause substantial/grievous economic injury, employer must notify employee:
- As soon as determination is made
- Of intent to deny restoration
- Of reasons for denial
- Employee's right to return and challenge denial


**Step 3:** Employee has opportunity to return immediately or request unpaid leave to end.


**Key Employee Notice Template:**
```
KEY EMPLOYEE DETERMINATION NOTICE


To: [Employee Name]
Date: __________
Re: Key Employee Status Under FMLA


You have requested FMLA leave beginning __________.


We are notifying you that you have been identified as a "key employee" 
under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). 


KEY EMPLOYEE DEFINITION:
A "key employee" is a salaried eligible employee who is among the 
highest paid 10% of employees within 75 miles of your worksite.


WHAT THIS MEANS:
As a key employee, you are entitled to take FMLA leave. However, 
[Company Name] MAY deny reinstatement if restoring you to your position 
would cause "substantial and grievous economic injury" to company 
operations.


CURRENT STATUS:
[ ] At this time, we do NOT anticipate denying reinstatement. You 
    may take FMLA leave as requested.


[ ] We are currently evaluating whether your reinstatement would 
    cause substantial economic injury. We will notify you as soon 
    as a determination is made.


IMPORTANT RIGHTS:
• You still have the right to take FMLA leave
• You will receive continued health insurance during leave
• If we determine reinstatement would cause economic injury, we 
  will notify you and explain our reasons
• You have the right to challenge any denial of reinstatement


NOTE: California CFRA does NOT have a "key employee" exception. 
If your leave qualifies under both FMLA and CFRA, CFRA protections 
may provide greater job security.


Questions? Contact [HR Contact] at [Phone/Email]


Sincerely,
[HR Representative]
```


**[ ] CFRA Protection for Key Employees:**


**CRITICAL:** Even if employer can deny FMLA reinstatement to key employee, employer **CANNOT** deny CFRA reinstatement (if leave qualifies under CFRA).


**Strategy for Employees:**
```
Employee is "key employee" under FMLA
Employee takes leave to care for sick grandparent


FMLA: Does NOT cover grandparent → Not FMLA-protected
CFRA: Covers grandparent → CFRA-protected


Result: Employee gets CFRA job protection despite being "key employee" 
(CFRA has no key employee exception)


Employer MUST reinstate employee
```


**Result:** Key employee exception has **limited practical value** in California because CFRA's broader family member coverage often provides protection where FMLA does not.

## **SECTION 6: COMPLEX LEAVE STACKING SCENARIOS**


### **6.1 Maximum Leave Exposure Calculations**

**Longest Possible Leave:**
```
PHASE 1: Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL)
Duration: 4 months maximum (17.3 weeks)
Covered by: PDL only
Reason: Disability due to pregnancy complications, childbirth, postpartum recovery


PHASE 2: CFRA Baby Bonding (runs concurrently with FMLA)
Duration: 12 weeks
Covered by: CFRA + FMLA (concurrent)
Reason: Bonding with newborn


TOTAL MAXIMUM LEAVE: 4 months + 12 weeks = ~29.3 weeks (~7.3 months)

Baby bonding (CFRA+FMLA): April 27 - July 19 (12 weeks)


Return to work: July 20, 2026


Total Leave: January 1 - July 19 = ~29 weeks
```


**Leave Balance Tracking:**
```
PDL Used: 16 weeks (bed rest + postpartum)
PDL Remaining: ~1 week (of 4-month entitlement)
CFRA Used: 12 weeks (baby bonding)
CFRA Remaining: 0 weeks
FMLA Used: 12 weeks (ran concurrent with CFRA bonding)
FMLA Remaining: 0 weeks
```

**Maximum Leave:**
```
CFRA Baby Bonding: 12 weeks
FMLA Baby Bonding: 12 weeks (runs concurrently with CFRA)


TOTAL: 12 weeks (not 24 weeks, because concurrent)
```


**Both Parents Take Leave Simultaneously:**
```
Mother (birthing parent):
- PDL: 8 weeks (postpartum recovery)
- CFRA: 12 weeks (baby bonding after PDL)
- Total: 20 weeks


Father (non-birthing parent):
- CFRA: 12 weeks (baby bonding, taken concurrently with mother's CFRA)
- Total: 12 weeks


Both parents can be on leave at same time during mother's CFRA phase (weeks 9-20)
```


**6.1.C Employee's Own Serious Health Condition + Later Family Care**


**Scenario:**
Employee has own serious health condition (uses FMLA/CFRA), then later in year needs to care for family member.


**Example:**
```
March 2026: Employee has surgery for own health condition
FMLA Used: 6 weeks (concurrent with CFRA)
CFRA Used: 6 weeks


Balances After Surgery:
FMLA Remaining: 6 weeks
CFRA Remaining: 6 weeks


September 2026: Employee's mother has stroke, needs care


If mother qualifies as "parent" under BOTH FMLA and CFRA:
FMLA Used: 6 weeks (concurrent)
CFRA Used: 6 weeks (concurrent)
Total Additional Leave: 6 weeks


If mother is "parent-in-law" (covered by CFRA but NOT FMLA):
CFRA Used: 6 weeks
FMLA: NOT used (preserved)
Total Additional Leave: 6 weeks CFRA


Second scenario is MORE FAVORABLE to employee because preserves FMLA for future use.
```


**6.1.D Workers' Compensation + FMLA/CFRA**


**Scenario:**
Employee injured on the job, receiving workers' compensation benefits.


**Leave Designation:**
- Workers' comp leave **CAN** run concurrently with FMLA/CFRA if employee has serious health condition
- Employer should designate as FMLA/CFRA (if qualifies) to avoid employee later claiming separate entitlements


**Example:**
```
Employee injured at work: Back injury requiring 10 weeks off


Workers' Comp: Pays wage replacement during leave
FMLA/CFRA: Provides job protection


Employer designates as: "FMLA and CFRA, concurrent, running concurrently with workers' compensation leave"


Result:
FMLA Used: 10 weeks
CFRA Used: 10 weeks
Workers' Comp: 10 weeks (same time period)


Employee's job is protected under FMLA/CFRA during workers' comp leave
```


**Critical Compliance Point:**
Employer **must** continue health insurance during FMLA leave even if employee receiving workers' comp (workers' comp does NOT provide health insurance continuation).


**6.1.E State Disability Insurance (SDI) / Paid Family Leave (PFL) Integration**


**California State Programs:**
- **State Disability Insurance (SDI):** Wage replacement for own disability (~60-70% wages)
- **Paid Family Leave (PFL):** Wage replacement for baby bonding or family care (~60-70% wages)


**Critical Understanding:**
- SDI and PFL are **NOT employer-provided leave** (they are state insurance programs)
- SDI/PFL provide **wage replacement** during **unpaid FMLA/CFRA/PDL leave**
- Employee can receive SDI/PFL payments while on job-protected leave


**Example:**
```
Employee on PDL for childbirth recovery:
- PDL: Provides job protection (4 months)
- SDI: Provides wage replacement (~60-70% of wages)
- Employer: Continues health insurance


Employee then takes CFRA for baby bonding:
- CFRA: Provides job protection (12 weeks)
- PFL: Provides wage replacement (~60-70% of wages)
- Employer: Continues health insurance


Employer's role: Facilitate employee's SDI/PFL applications, continue health insurance, track leave usage
Employer does NOT pay SDI/PFL benefits (state program)
```


**Employer Obligations:**
- Provide SDI/PFL claim forms when employee goes on leave
- Complete employer portion of claim forms
- Do NOT delay leave approval while waiting for SDI/PFL determination
- Continue health insurance regardless of SDI/PFL approval

## **SECTION 7: NEW PARENT LEAVE ACT (NPLA) - GAP COVERAGE FOR 20-49 EMPLOYEES**


### **7.1 Purpose and Applicability**


**Legal Authority:** Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.6 (Not to be confused with Reproductive Loss Leave at same code section)


**Historical Context:**
- Prior to 2021: CFRA applied only to employers with 50+ employees
- 2021: CFRA expanded to 5+ employees
- Gap: Employers with 20-49 employees were covered by CFRA but NOT federal FMLA
- NPLA: Created in 2020 to fill gap for employers with 20-49 employees (before CFRA expansion)


**Current Status (2026):**
NPLA is largely **redundant** with CFRA (since CFRA now applies to 5+ employees), but still exists as separate statute.


**[ ] Threshold:** **20 to 49 employees**


**Purpose:** Ensure employees at smaller employers (not covered by FMLA) can take baby bonding leave.


### **7.2 Leave Entitlement**


**[ ] Amount:** **12 weeks** of unpaid leave for baby bonding


**[ ] Eligibility:**
- 12 months of service
- 1,250 hours worked in prior 12 months
- Employer has 20-49 employees


**[ ] Qualifying Reasons:**
- Birth of child
- Adoption of child
- Foster care placement


**[ ] Critical Limitation:**
NPLA covers **baby bonding ONLY** (not employee's own serious health condition or family care).


### **7.3 Relationship to CFRA**


**For Employers with 20-49 Employees:**


**CFRA** now covers:
- Baby bonding
- Employee's own serious health condition
- Family member care
- Military exigency


**NPLA** covers:
- Baby bonding only


**Result:**
NPLA is **redundant** with CFRA for baby bonding. Employers should just comply with CFRA (which provides broader coverage).


**Best Practice:**
Employers with 20-49 employees should:
- Treat NPLA as part of CFRA compliance
- Use CFRA policies and forms
- Reference CFRA in employee communications (NPLA rarely mentioned)

## **SECTION 10: SAMPLE COMBINED FMLA/CFRA POLICY FOR 50+ EMPLOYEES**


```
[COMPANY NAME]
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY (FMLA/CFRA)
Effective Date: January 1, 2026


PURPOSE:
[Company Name] provides eligible employees with unpaid, job-protected 
leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the 
California Family Rights Act (CFRA), as well as Pregnancy Disability 
Leave (PDL) under California law.


APPLICABILITY:
This policy applies to all employees of [Company Name] who meet 
eligibility requirements.


--- ELIGIBILITY ---


To be eligible for FMLA and CFRA leave, you must:
1. Have worked for [Company Name] for at least 12 months
2. Have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before leave
3. (FMLA only) Work at a location where we employ 50 or more employees 
   within 75 miles


NOTE: CFRA has no geographic limitation. You may be eligible for CFRA 
even if not eligible for FMLA.


--- LEAVE ENTITLEMENT ---


FMLA AND CFRA (12 WEEKS):
Eligible employees may take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave in a 
12-month period for:


• Birth of your child and to bond with newborn (within 1 year of birth)
• Placement of child with you for adoption or foster care (within 1 year)
• Your own serious health condition that makes you unable to work
• Care for your spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition
• Qualifying exigency arising from covered military service


CFRA ONLY (Broader Family Coverage):
CFRA also covers leave to care for:
• Parent-in-law
• Grandparent
• Grandchild
• Sibling
• Designated person (one person per year related by blood or equivalent 
  family relationship)


If you take leave for these family members, your FMLA entitlement is 
preserved for other uses.


MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE (26 WEEKS - FMLA ONLY):
Up to 26 workweeks in a single 12-month period to care for covered 
servicemember with serious injury or illness.


PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE (UP TO 4 MONTHS):
Female employees disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical 
condition may take up to 4 months of leave per pregnancy. PDL is 
separate from and in addition to CFRA. See separate PDL policy.


12-MONTH PERIOD:
We calculate the 12-month period using [SELECT ONE]:
[ ] Calendar year (January 1 - December 31)
[ ] Rolling 12-month period measured backward from date leave is used


--- REQUESTING LEAVE ---


ADVANCE NOTICE:
• Foreseeable leave (e.g., planned surgery, expected childbirth): 
  Provide 30 days' advance notice
• Unforeseeable leave (e.g., emergency): Notify us as soon as practicable


HOW TO REQUEST:
1. Complete Employee Leave Request Form (available from HR)
2. Submit to [HR Contact] or your supervisor
3. We will provide written notice of your eligibility within 5 business days


You do not need to specifically request "FMLA" or "CFRA" leave. Simply 
explain your need for time off, and we will determine which laws apply.


--- MEDICAL CERTIFICATION ---


For leaves based on a serious health condition, you must provide medical 
certification from a healthcare provider within 15 days.


We will provide the appropriate certification form:
• WH-380-E: For your own serious health condition
• WH-380-F: For family member's serious health condition


If certification is incomplete, you will have 7 days to correct it.


For baby bonding or military exigency leave, medical certification is 
not required.


--- LEAVE DESIGNATION ---


We will notify you in writing within 5 business days whether your leave 
qualifies as FMLA and/or CFRA leave.


CONCURRENT DESIGNATION:
In most cases, leave that qualifies under both FMLA and CFRA will run 
concurrently (the same time counts toward both). For example:
• Your own serious health condition
• Baby bonding (for non-birthing parent)
• Care for spouse, child, or biological parent


SEPARATE DESIGNATION:
In some cases, leave runs under only one law:
• PDL: Separate from CFRA and FMLA
• Care for California-only family members (grandparent, etc.): CFRA only
• Military caregiver (26 weeks): FMLA only


--- PAID LEAVE SUBSTITUTION ---


FMLA and CFRA leave is unpaid. However, you may use accrued paid leave:


YOU MAY CHOOSE TO USE:
• Accrued vacation or PTO
• Accrued paid sick leave (if qualifying reason)


REQUIRED USE (per company policy):
[Company may specify if paid leave must be used, or leave it voluntary]


Using paid leave does not extend your FMLA/CFRA entitlement. The 12 
weeks includes any paid leave used.


--- HEALTH INSURANCE CONTINUATION ---


We will continue your group health insurance during FMLA/CFRA/PDL leave 
on the same terms as if you were actively working.


You must continue to pay your share of the premium: $_____ per month.


PAYMENT METHODS:
• If using paid leave: Payroll deduction continues
• If unpaid leave: [Specify payment method - direct payment, etc.]


If your premium payment is more than 30 days late, we may cancel your 
coverage after providing 15 days' written notice.


--- JOB RESTORATION ---


When you return from leave, you will be reinstated to:
• Your same position, OR
• An equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, shift, and 
  working conditions


"Equivalent position" does not mean identical, but it must have 
substantially similar duties, pay, benefits, and opportunities.


FITNESS-FOR-DUTY CERTIFICATION:
If your leave was for your own serious health condition, you may be 
required to provide a healthcare provider's statement that you are able 
to return to work and perform the essential functions of your job.


--- KEY EMPLOYEE NOTICE (FMLA ONLY) ---


If you are a "key employee" (salaried and among the highest-paid 10% 
of employees within 75 miles), we may deny reinstatement if restoring 
you would cause substantial and grievous economic injury to our operations.


We will notify you if you are a key employee when you request leave.


NOTE: California CFRA does not have a "key employee" exception. Even if 
FMLA reinstatement can be denied, CFRA reinstatement rights may still apply.


--- INTERMITTENT AND REDUCED SCHEDULE LEAVE ---


If medically necessary, you may take FMLA/CFRA leave intermittently 
(in separate blocks of time) or on a reduced schedule (part-time).


We track intermittent leave in [15-minute / 1-hour] increments.


For baby bonding leave, intermittent or reduced schedule is permitted 
only with [Company Name] approval.


--- STATE DISABILITY PROGRAMS ---


California provides wage replacement programs during unpaid leave:
• State Disability Insurance (SDI): For your own disability
• Paid Family Leave (PFL): For baby bonding or family care


These are STATE programs, not employer-provided benefits. We will assist 
you in applying for SDI/PFL, but we do not pay these benefits.


Receiving SDI or PFL does not extend your FMLA/CFRA leave entitlement.


--- RETALIATION PROHIBITED ---


We will not retaliate against you for requesting or taking FMLA, CFRA, 
or PDL leave. Retaliation includes:
• Termination, demotion, or discipline
• Reduction in pay or hours
• Denial of promotion or opportunities
• Counting FMLA/CFRA leave against you in performance evaluations or 
  attendance policies


If you believe you have been retaliated against, report immediately to 
[HR Contact / Compliance Officer].
