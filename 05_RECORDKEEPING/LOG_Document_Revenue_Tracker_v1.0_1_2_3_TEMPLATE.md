Subject: California Compliance Deadline - Workplace Violence Prevention (SB 553)

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Business Name] on LinkedIn and wanted to reach out about a critical compliance deadline affecting California businesses.

As of [EFFECTIVE DATE], SB 553 requires all CA employers to have a written Workplace Violence Prevention Plan and provide annual training to all employees.

Non-compliance penalties: [AMOUNT] per employee per violation.

For a business with [X] employees, that's a potential $[X × 500] penalty exposure.

I help LA-area businesses like yours avoid these penalties through turnkey compliance programs:
• Written WVPP customized for your industry
• Professional training delivery (1 hour, all employees)
• Compliance certificates & documentation
• Annual renewal reminders

Bundled with harassment prevention training (also required), your all-in cost is [AMOUNT] for full 2-year compliance.

Best regards,
