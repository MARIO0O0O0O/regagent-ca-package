## Content Strategy Notes

**Blog** — prioritize articles around California's annual compliance cycle
(January minimum wage, February SB 294, etc.) and high-PAGA-exposure topics.
These drive organic search traffic and establish authority.

**Compliance Alerts** — these are the highest-value customer retention tool.
An employer who misses a deadline has real exposure; timely alerts build trust.
Format: one-page, plain language, actionable, with a direct link to the
relevant package.

**Case Studies** — always anonymized and aggregate. Never identify clients.
Frame as "a Southern California employer with 45 employees..." Focus on
the compliance gap, the risk, and the resolution. These convert prospects.

**Employer Guides** — high-value lead magnets. A "Complete Compliance Guide
for California Restaurants" or "HR Compliance for Small Employers Under 50"
bundles multiple packages into one narrative document.

**Glossary** — foundational SEO asset. "What is PAGA?", "What is a Wage Order?",
"What is the difference between CFRA and FMLA?" are high-volume searches.
