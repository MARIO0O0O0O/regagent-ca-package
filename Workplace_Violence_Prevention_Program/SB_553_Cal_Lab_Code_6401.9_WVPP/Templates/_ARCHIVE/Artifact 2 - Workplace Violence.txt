1. Establishment and Implementation of the Written Plan

The plan shall be in effect at all times and in all work areas and be specific to the hazards and corrective measures for each work area and operation."
A. Structural Integrity and Site Specificity
* Plan Customization Requirements
   * [ ] Site-Specific Hazard Mapping: Develop distinct procedures for each work area and operation rather than relying on a generic corporate template.
   * [ ] Accessibility Standards: Maintain the plan in a format (digital or physical) that is "easily accessible" to all staff and union representatives at all times during work shifts.
   * [ ] IIPP Integration: Incorporate the WVPP as a standalone section within the existing Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) or maintain it as a cross-referenced separate document.
* Responsible Personnel Designation
   * [ ] Role Clarification: List the names or job titles of all individuals responsible for implementing the plan, clearly describing their specific roles if multiple persons are involved.
B. Operational Procedures and Employee Involvement
* Active Participation Protocols
   * [ ] Collaborative Development: Establish formal procedures to obtain the "active involvement" of employees in identifying workplace violence hazards and designing training programs.
   * [ ] Incident Reporting: Implement clear, confidential channels for reporting threats or violent incidents to the employer or law enforcement without fear of reprisal.
* Emergency Response and Communication
   * [ ] Threat Alert Systems: Deploy effective means to alert employees regarding the presence, location, and nature of a workplace violence emergency.
   * [ ] Evacuation Protocols: Define site-specific evacuation or sheltering plans that are appropriate for the physical layout of the workspace.
2. Violent Incident Log Management and Privacy Standards
Legal Authority: Cal. Lab. Code § 6401.9(d) Mandate: > "The employer shall record every workplace violence incident in a violent incident log... The employer shall omit any element of personal identifying information sufficient to allow identification of any person involved in a violent incident, such as the person's name, address, electronic mail address, telephone number, social security number, or other information..."
A. Log Content and Classification
* Mandatory Incident Metadata
   * [ ] Required Data Fields: Record the date, time, and specific location of every incident, alongside a detailed description and the circumstances at the time of the event.
   * [ ] Violence Type Classification: Categorize every entry by type: Type 1 (Criminal Intent), Type 2 (Customer/Client), Type 3 (Worker-on-Worker), or Type 4 (Personal Relationship).
   * [ ] Corrective Actions: Document what specific steps were taken to protect employees from further threats following the incident.
* Privacy and Redaction Compliance
   * [ ] PII Removal: Verify that no names, email addresses, or phone numbers of victims or perpetrators are recorded in the shared log.
   * [ ] Solicited Information: Ensure log entries are based on information solicited directly from the employees who experienced the violence or from witness statements.
B. Record Retention and Disclosure
* Availability and Review Deadlines
   * [ ] Five-Year Retention: Maintain all violent incident logs, hazard inspection records, and incident investigation reports for a minimum of five years.
   * [ ] Employee Disclosure: Provide a copy of the log to any employee or authorized representative within 15 calendar days of a request.
3. Mandatory Training and Interactive Instruction
Legal Authority: Cal. Lab. Code § 6401.9(e) Mandate: > "The employer shall provide effective training to employees... initially when the plan is first established, and annually thereafter... The training shall include: The employer's Plan... workplace violence hazards specific to the employees' jobs... [and] an opportunity for interactive questions and answers with a person knowledgeable about the employer's plan."
A. Training Frequency and Interactive Standards
* Annual Retraining Cycle
   * [ ] Initial and Annual Delivery: Administer training when the plan is first established and every year thereafter, regardless of whether the plan has changed.
   * [ ] Interactive Q&A requirement: Ensure every training session offers a real-time opportunity for employees to ask questions of a person knowledgeable about the specific site plan.
* Curriculum Specificity
   * [ ] Site-Specific Hazards: Cover the specific workplace violence hazards identified for the employee's particular job and location.
   * [ ] Reporting and Log Access: Instruct employees on how to report incidents without fear of reprisal and how to obtain copies of the violent incident log.
B. Recordkeeping and Metadata
* SB 513 Documentation Compliance
   * [ ] Training Log Fields: Capture the employee's name, the training provider's name, the date, and the "Core Competencies" addressed (e.g., "De-escalation," "Hazard Identification," "Reporting Procedures").
   * [ ] One-Year Retention: Store training records for at least one year.
4. Hazard Identification, Evaluation, and Correction
Legal Authority: Cal. Lab. Code § 6401.9(c)(2)(I) Mandate: > "Procedures to identify and evaluate workplace violence hazards... scheduled periodic inspections... shall be conducted when the plan is first established, after each workplace violence incident, and whenever the employer is made aware of a new or previously unrecognized hazard."
A. Scheduled and Triggered Inspections
* Inspection Frequency
   * [ ] Initial Assessment: Conduct a full-site walkthrough to identify blind spots, poor lighting, or unauthorized entry points when the plan is first established.
   * [ ] Post-Incident Evaluation: Trigger an immediate inspection and hazard re-evaluation following any violent incident or reported threat.
   * [ ] Annual Review: Perform a comprehensive review of the plan's effectiveness and the site's hazards at least annually.
* Engineering and Work Practice Controls
   * [ ] Physical Security Audits: Evaluate the need for electronic access controls, weapon detectors, or bullet-resistant glass in high-risk zones.
   * [ ] Operational Adjustments: Implement rules for employees working alone or in isolated areas, such as improved illumination or "buddy system" requirements.
